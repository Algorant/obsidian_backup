## Notes
- Franklin disowned his son? dang. was royal mayor of NJ?
- Your servant? was that a goodbye
- Jefferson interesting casting
- Is that the guy from better call saul
- Why was NJ absent? Anything more there?
- The guy seconding the motion, when he was like omg
- Did the NJ dudes really come in at last minute?
- "But I burn"? from Jefferson. Horny on main?
- This is fantastically shot. I would love to see other movies from the 70s that had this kind of camera work
	- going up the stairs scene, the congress scenes, camera constantly moving
- fondle them but don't finger them
- Gain maryland and lose the entire south quote
- Ben franklin reminded me of penn jilette
