## Notes
- Spielberg level transition at the beginning 
- trailer set piece is 10/10 for sure
- very convoluted dialogue compared to first. Cross cutting and multiple people 
- tent and run set piece
- compsugnathus with sarsgaard guy was lame
- raptor set piece stakes were even higher this time
- they're evacuated, but there's still plenty more movie though 
- blockbuster with fake movies
