## Notes
- Space sounds! nobody gave a fuck in the 70s
- remaster definitely shows its benefits
- what are some of the changes?
- transition swipe in the desert! classic. Did they start that?
- voiceover seemed desync'd from the mouths. Prob just my setup
- Iconic double moon shot with the music playing still works great
- "You fought in the clone wars?" is that an edit?
- droid punching in first mos-eisley
- Ok so there was the original theatrical, then the vhs one, then the one that came out with the prequels?
- cantina diddy still hype
- still don't understand the [[Obi-Wan]] disappearing thing, feels bad
