## Basics

### Jumping
- Huge opportunity for damaging
- Very powerful attack
- Difficult to counter if you are new
- At higher levels of play, a lot more risky and not done often

### Dashing
- Lets you get in and out quickly
- In SF6*, backdash beats throw on wakeup (useful in the corner)

### Normals 
- Light, Medium, Heavy Punch and Kick, 6 buttons
- jab, strong, fierce
- short, forward, roundhouse
### Blocking
- Jump attacks need to be blocked standing up
- Low attacked need to be blocked crouching

### Throws
- Used in combination with attacking and blocking in order to open the game up

### Special Moves
- Fireball, aka projectile
- Uppercut, aka dp
- Spin Kicks, aka tatsu (tatsumaki sempu-kyaku)
- Vary depending on what strength, usually a tradeoff of speed for power

### Super Moves
- Every character has a level 1, a level 2, and a level 3. 
- Level 3 turns into a CA at low health

### Rock - Paper - Scissors Aspect
- Block beats hit
- Throw beats block
- Hit beats throw
- Every Fighting game is based around this game of rock paper scissors

### The HUD
- Health bars
- Round
- Timer
- Drive Gauge
- Meter Gauge

## Intermediate Concepts

### Footsies
- The name for the metagame of going in and out of your opponents attack range, delicate balance
### Wakeup
- Your options after being knocked down. 
- You can try for a reversal, but if the opponent blocks, you are in for a big punish 
### Cross - Up
- Aerial moves designed to hit your opponent after jumping over their head
- Very powerful combined with jumping, especially at lower levels
- At high levels, very ambiguous, player might not even know what side
- SF6 specifically doesn't have too much of this, but it does happen
### Anti - Air
- Moves designed specifically to counter jump attacks

### Target Combos
- Ryu HP to HK leads to denjin charge

### Overheads
- Grounded moves that specifically hit high while on the ground, so will hit someone doing crouch block.
### Frame Advantage / Frame Data
- Every move has 3 phases:
	- Startup - The time it takes from you pressing the button until it is able to "hit" the opponent
	- Active Frames - The amount of frames that an attack is able to hit an opponent
	- Recovery - The time between the end of active frames, and going back to neutral, aka the Bad Place.
### Counter Hits
- When you hit your opponent in the process of them attacking
### Reversals
- Name designation for special attacks done on wakeup to stop an opponents attacking momentum
### Knockdowns: Soft and Hard
- You have the ability to recover differently from soft knockdowns, 
- hard knockdowns have you remain on the ground for a set amount of time, usually letting the attacker continue the advantage or pressure in some way

## Advanced Concepts

### Blockstring
- When an opponent is attacking, but there is not enough room between hits for you to attack

### Chip damage
- Damage done to your healthbar while blocking. Kind of mitigated in SF6 and not relevant except in certain situations.
### Mixup
- A situation that a player creates for an opponent that gives them very little time to react between different options, in the sense that they will usually have to "guess" between what option to choose without much information as to what will be most advantageous.
### Meaty
- Moves timed so that they are in active frames at the earliest possible moment of an opponents recovery, further limits options. Loses to reversal
### Safe Jump / Safe Setups
- Moves systematically designed to be difficult to counter, or in very tight windows where it further limits the opponents options
- Usually in the corner after hard knockdown
### Option Selects
- Specifically weighted options in certain situations that are kind of like playing rock and paper at once. More like 1.5 than 2, and will still have a counter, but you get the gist.

### Corner Carry  / General Stage Positioning
- The corner is bad because it limits your movement generally.
- There's players that love just being full screen and doing projectiles, and there are characters designed around that

### Cognitive Load
- No one can hold every possible action and counter in their head, SF6 deliberately added many things so as to have a component of uneasiness compared to other games.
- You have to selectively focus on a few things at a time, say 3 or 4 out of 7 or 8 at any given time. Great players can probably do 5 or 6, and use things like option selects and safe jumps to cover the blindspots.

## SF6 Specific Mechanics
### Drive Rush
- Works as both combo extender, and for a gap closer.
- Lets you rush in to your opponents space for pressure. Also known as yeeting across the screen.
- Also lets you link together moves that otherwise wouldn't, using drive gauge

### Drive Parry
- Allows you to absorb moves without taking damage
- If done on the first frame, special animation and considered a "perfect" parry. Gives you meter instead of taking it away.

### Drive Impact
- Very powerful at low levels, both for lower level players and for advanced players
- Adds another wrinkle to corner play, to threat level at any time, to meter management

### Drive Reversal
- When you press drive Impact after your opponent has pressed theirs, but before it connects
- Causes slow-mo, kind of an Uno Reverse tactic

### Drive Counter
- Lets you interrupt a blockstring or otherwise opressive, multi-hit move. If the opponent is doing something, it will hit them.

### Burnout
- The state you are put in if you use all of your drive gauge
- You take chip, you cannot drive Impact (meaning you can't drive reversal, and drive impacts are unblockable)

### Wallslam / "Crush"
- If you block a drive impact too close to the wall instead of counter it
- The corner is absolutely brutal in this game, in general

### Stagger Counter (What is the real name? IDK)
- Punish counter with certain moves (usually heavy) will stagger enemy just like Drive Impact

### Character Archetypes
- Shotos
	- Examples: Ryu, Ken Akuma
- Charge Characters 
	- Examples: Guile, Boxer, Blanka
- Rushdown
	- Examples: Cammy, Ed
- Grapplers
	- Specialize in Command Grabs
	- Examples: Zangief, Manon
- Mixup / Gimmick Characters

## Other Terms and Fun Trivia

### Dictator / Claw / Bison
- In US
	- Balrog is Boxing guy
	- Vega is Spanish Claw guy
	- M. Bison is Psycho Power Dictator guy
- In Japan
	- Balrog -> Claw
	- Bison -> Short for Mike Bison, aka play on Mike Tyson
	- Lord Vega -> The Dictator
- Was done to avoid lawsuit? Or Just coding mistake? Unknown

### Game Differentiation
- Soul Caliber is based on characters having weapons, so there is one button for Horizontal Attacks, one for Vertical attacks
- Tekken has one button for each limb
- Smash bros has normal moves button, special move button, block button, attacks vary depending on direction you press alongside
- But they all have a basic RPS loop at their base more often than not
