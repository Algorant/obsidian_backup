## Journal

Had a big scare yesterday with #Obsidian where I tried using sync and accidentally used an option that restored a bunch of old files, and that corrupted my sync for all devices.

Thankfully I was using #git backups on main machine and that worked like a charm. I learned how things like #git reset and #git revert work, and the difference between the two.

The reason that was happening was I erased #manjaro off of my laptop and just put straight [[Arch]] on it.  Fun process. The idea was to try out #hyprland as a #wm on it, but instead I decided to put my existing [[qtile]] setup on it, along with the other dotfiles. Learned a lot in the process! I have it all documented in [[Arch Install on LG Laptop]] note.
