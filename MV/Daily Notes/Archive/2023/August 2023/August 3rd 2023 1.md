## Journal

I continued doing [[Chumba]] today for the third time in earnest. I've done around ~100 envelopes of what [[Stephen]] calls #pre-work. My hand begins to hurt if I don't really focus on my technique, but I think doing around 100 of these a week should not be too bad of an achievable goal, along with having [[Robochumba]] off and running by end of October.

I also received the #axi-draw and messed around with it earlier this week.

There's been lots of talk of a new superconductor being found, called #LK-99. It is revolutionary for multiple reasons, but mainly because it works at around room temperature, and is reproducible using very basic equipment.

There has also been talk of a revolutionary new anti-cancer drug. It is taken orally and has a very cool molecular shape. Very early days but Phase I trials are underway.

This weekend we will be doing the carwash, I will finish the [[Picnic Table]], and hopefully I can send these first 100 #chumbas out.

I messed around quite a bit with getting my [[ArchWSL]] working the way I want it. and the [[Arch Install on LG Laptop]] is going great as well. I kept it in [[qtile]] for now, and will mess with #hyprland at a different time. I think my [[qtile]] #config looks great and can keep going from here.
