## Journal
- I don't need grace, or patience. I need a double check. I need a triple check. I need more check ins. But you also have to recognize and want to check in too. At some point that went away or became super distant priority.
- I am asking for help. I am asking for something extra right now, in this moment where for whatever reason, things are being escalated between us. You get touched out, or overstimulated, or anything like that you just need a break. You demean when I need one too.
- The 1-5 thing. This is a 5 for me. The highest. I can't keep taking the negatives without a balanced positive feedback AT SOME POINT.I am gonna have like 1 or 2 5s a year. It should be drip everything and listen.
