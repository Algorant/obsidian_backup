## Journal

I am testing writing in longer form to see how much it actually takes to write those 1500-2000 words I need to write every day to meet [[NaNoWriMo 2023]].  Just going to write off the cuff on my life to see how easy it is.

[[Nova]] is incredible. She is starting to fully crawl, and is getting up to full speed soon. She is climbing absolutely everything. It's so crazy how different she is from [[Bodin]].  She takes in everything, is so determined, tries to grab everything, but is just as observant as he is.

We also believe she is starting to say her first words. We are working on pointing to different members of the family and saying their name, including her. She loves to smile and it takes a couple seconds for it to register, but she is definitely responding to the stimulus. Her babbles do approximates "Ma ma ma ma" and "Da da da da da" fairly often. We are still working on "Bo", haha.

So for the novel, I still need to flesh out the settings, the characters, the outline, and a few other things. I got a couple good #showerthoughts about how to add certain easter eggs, inside jokes, homages, and etc. I am debating whether to make it self aware, as it will likely be some form of the "play within a play" #trope.

I believe that [[Obsidian]] is going to be great and make this revolutionary and a cinch. It lets me link ideas, reference things, keeps track of word count, and when it comes time to publishing, all my chapters will be in easy #markdown files that are easy to upload somewhere. I will probably use a [[Hugo]] template that I found the other day and upload it there in some fashion. That can be in December, however.

[[Robochumba]] is going well. I have definitely procrastinated a lot, but I am getting the whole process fully automated in these next two weeks.  I need to get some timings down on how long things take, but right now 8 cards takes roughly 30 minutes, and 6 envelopes takes roughly 15 minutes.  I will probably alternate days so as to not have to context switch as much.

I love my new laptop. It's a [[Thinkpad X1 Nano]] Gen 1. It was severely discounted off when it was brand new, as they are on Gen 3 now I think. Anyway it's been awesome fully customizing it the way I want, with a fully decked out [[hyprland]] configuration. I am learning a lot of lower level system stuff, as well as some customization tips. And I am also obviously falling in love with [[gruvbox]] all over again.

Work is going well. There is a transition happening, where our department got combined with another foreign department, and the entire wing of the company is getting spun off into its own standalone corporation. Lots of things are up in the air, but fortunately my manager [[Tanbeer]] is basically the best manager I've ever had and seems to have been born for these types of situations. He quickly identified what teams need help in the department that took us over, and is setting up meetings with people who desperately need some #data-engineering in their lives.

We are probably going to move to an all new tech stack, including tools I am thus far unfamilar with such as [[Alteryx]] and [[redshift]], but as always I love learning new tools, and using [[Obsidian]] makes it super easy to keep track of where I'm at and where I'm going for each individual thing. 

Desk Organization continues to be a struggle. I've switched to the laptop during a work meeting to see how typing longform is on here. Not to bad. Still not relaxed but getting there. But ok, my desk. I made the decision to have kind of a "server corner" in the back corner. That should have the router, the laptop dock, the [[Blockclock Micro]], the [[Nodebox]], and any kind of #nas situation I create in the future. I also should consider making the [[pihole]] and other things back there.

On the other side, there's plenty of bills and stuff I need to move out of here. And finally with all of that is wiring. I can probably remove the [[Nodebox]] from HDMI and get it out from under the desk. But, slowly but surely I will make progress on it!

[[Street Fighter 6| SF6]] is in an intereting state. I am loving my main, [[Manon]]. I think she is so fun and great. I definitely have a lot to learn, but I think with a couple improvements I can get to #master rank.  Following the tournament scene again has been fun as well. I know the [[Manon]] mains that I like to watch are [[iDom]] and some japanese players. The meta is super interesting, the top tier is kind of well established, but there are still lots of surprises and new tech being discovered.

[[Lords of the Fallen]] seems like an interesting new #souls-like game. I will probably play it soon. I still have not finished [[Sea of Stars]], so that takes priority. Maybe I can get through that in these next two weeks so I'm not playing much for [[NaNoWriMo 2023]].
