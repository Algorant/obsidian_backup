## Journal

Washing machine is still broken today. It's [[Jonah]]s real birthday.

[[Lisa]] went to her parent's house with [[Nova]] to do some laundry, while [[Bodin]] and I chilled at home.  We read some books, watched [[The Good Dinosaur]], and then went for a long walk.

Also talked with the boys. I found this thread about [[John Calhoun]], who created the original "paradise of mice", and his subsequent experiments. I posted the thread but [[Derek]] really zoomed in on the user and their conclusions, which admittedly were absolutely braindead, but I wasn't interested in talking about that at all.

Unfortunately it started a whole discussion about the former rather than the later, and then a meta discussion, and then an offshoot, and we never really got around to talking about it.

- Description:: Person uses #chatgpt in a notebook rather than the GUI. Probably some good snippets and code to use for [[GPT Slackbot]]
