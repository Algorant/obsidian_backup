## Journal

I installed [[Arch]] on my [[WSL]] on the desktop and man it was easy. All that time I've put in managing my #dotfiles  with [[gnu stow]] and getting to know modern #unix tools is finally paying off.

I just love the concept of rolling releases and the [[AUR]].  [[neovim]] is better than ever. Tiling window mangers are not intimidating anymore, now that I've messed with #awesome and [[qtile]].
