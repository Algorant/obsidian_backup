## Journal

Had 4th of July yesterday
Lots of interesting discoveries today in #techworld.

There is a company called [[Reolink]] that is creating nice consumer recording hardware like doorbells and security cameras, and making them easy to #diy and make at home solutions without relying on cloud.  Will definitely be looking into those.

Also #nvme m.2 hard drives are getting very cheap. You can get a 2tb Gen 3 for like$60-70, and a 2tb Gen 4 for under $100. I will probably be getting some of these for the laptop and the desktop.
