## Journal
Took control of the finances again today. Not going to worry about the upcoming medical bills too much. "Its just money, you'll make more" #quotes.  But we had to stop the hemorrhaging a bit.  

So, it will be back to debit only. We will freeze the cards and keep them at zero, and get our budgeting back on track.  This will give me a much better idea of what to do with next steps.

I am pretty sure [[Chumba]] will be in play soon, and maybe [[Robochumba]] after that. If not, I will still have [[Bitboards]] and many other ideas.
