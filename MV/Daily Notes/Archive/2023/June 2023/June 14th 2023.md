### Journal

I woke up with just [[Nova]] this morning. The night was rough. I had to use a syringe to feed her since we never kept up with bottles. Miserable but we made it through. Felt like waterboarding

The morning was nice and then [[Marilda]] came over and took over and was able to get her to take a bottle more routinely after lots of struggle. God bless grandmas.

Then I came to the hospital. [[Lisa]] has two procedures today. The endoscopy, and then the gallbladder removal.

I stayed with her until it was time to go into the operating room.  They told me it would be a few hours so I went to #publix to get a sandwich. While I was there I got a call from #tamarac, where the hospital is,  and didn't have service and couldn't get anyone when I called back.  Scary

But then [[Ulises]] called and let me know everything was ok and first procedure went great.

I just got the call from the doctor of the second procedure that everything went well there too. I am absolutely overjoyed. I try not to let things get to me, but when the relief comes I think I feel the same as anyone else.
