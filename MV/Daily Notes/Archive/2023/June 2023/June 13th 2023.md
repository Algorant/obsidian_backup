### Ideas for Templating
- Add Emojis:
	- Book, Movie, etc...
- Have redundant data for genre, type of media, etc
	- So something like genre can be in tags, but also somewhere else
	- Type of media can be denoted by that emoji, etc 
- Have a recommended by section in the template for each media thing. Could be something rec'd by friends or by interesting people, etc
- Have author and director pages with a [[Dataview]] query that updates what they've done 
	- [[FromSergio]] covers this in his videos

### Journaling

Spent the night with [[Nova]] and woke up with her when [[Bodin]] opened the door. It was rough and she didn't really eat. Lisa was at the hospital waiting to get the MRI to show results of her gallbladder issues.

Went to hospital in the morning and entire day was exhausting but very fulfilling. I had either one or the other kid and was taking care of them while going here and there during the day. 

Now its night and [[Bodin]] is sleeping over at grandma and grandpas, while I'm with [[Nova]]. Its been rough trying to get her to take a bottle. But I am determined. I had to use a syringe tonight and basically waterboard her. Not pleasant. We will make it through together.

I am really loving #Obsidian and I can see myself putting lots of time into finally creating my #second-brain for real.

I want to build out my todos, and do things like get back to journaling, tracking my mood, and explore just what is possible with this crazy program.
