## Journal
Lazy Saturday. My first one using #Obsidian ! 

Woke up later than usual, [[Bodin]] had a 1:30 am wakeup but nbd. [[Lisa]] is well on her way to recovery and basically back to near 100%. 

[[Nova]] is taking the bottle with formula just fine. We are going to try to keep that up daily. I'm not sure about that cadence, but I am determined to make an effort with it.

Its around noon. I'm home with [[Nova]] and [[Lisa]] and [[Bodin]] are out running errands. He needs a haircut and she needed to get him some clothes for tonight.

Tonight is [[Jonah]]s #bar-mitzvah. It will be the first one I've ever been to.
