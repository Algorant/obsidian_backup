Talked with the boys about my existential agida about whatever this completionism thing I have is. I called it #fomo , but maybe its a more than that. And maybe its not so great. I'm dealing with it the best way I know how. This feels do-able. This feels conquerable.

We came home today after [[Lisa]]s surgery. I was feeling some feelings. I'm not sure of the locus, but everything just felt off. I felt a little bit unappreciated with basically everything I had done the past couple days. I know she wasn't doing it on purpose, but it just made me very sad.
