## Journal
Got a good amount of #work done today. Progress is going really well with my #obsidian as well. I think I finally have a #gtd and #pkm system that I can stick to and love with all my heart. I am so excited every day to customize and fit it to my liking.

I absolutely adore the community and plugin system already. [[Dataview]] and canvas' are a total game changer, as well.

Having so much fun building out all of these dashboards. They are so easy. Still lots to figure out, but the future is bright.
