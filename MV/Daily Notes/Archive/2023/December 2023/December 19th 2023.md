## Thoughts

Using video on telescoping rods:
- Kitchen
	- Can secure pots and pans in drawer
	- Can separate to have lids on the side
	- Can make new layer under sink to hold baskets
	- Works great for paper towels hidden away
- Bathrooms
	- Toilet paper shelf
	- Spray bottles
- Closets
	- Towels vertical or horizontal
	- Small shelf
	- Shoes, balls, baskets, umbrellas
- Drawers
	- Keeping rows of clothes separate
	-
