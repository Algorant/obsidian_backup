## Components

#### Parsing / Cleaning / Filtering
- Create empty ACM Table
- Create Updatable Master Fuzzy File
- Organized by [[Socket Tracing - Documentation#Client List ||Client]]
- Creating [[Testing Suite]] for Processing
- 
#### Uploading
- Updating Master List
- Updating Matched and Unmatched Lists
- Upload to ACM

#### Knime / Alteryx Integrations
- Individual scripts should be usable inside of these programs

#### Parts needed:

- Components from SQL
	- Direct Sales
	- Standalone Install Base
	- Bed and Procedures
	- MID Columns
- Components from lookup (current excel, should be SQL)
	- Override Table
	- Product Matching Table
	- Customer Validation Table
	- 

#### Misc Issues
- OEM_Ctry was missing from direct sales when translated from SQL to python
- You need to add in the Install Base Filter to the flow at some later point, removed it for now
