## Misc

- Test Suite Info
	- [ ] Modify Testing
		- [ ] Test 1 Function needs the check for if consumables total is 0. I just did a quick and dirty fix for Thursday meeting
	- [x] Summarize Automation
		- [ ] Just certify large amount with testing
		- [ ] Add full dataset
		- [ ] Test 3
			- [ ] Only OEM accounts, high threshold fuzzy match
		- [ ] Test 5
			- [ ] If no IDN_NM, and the other two requirements, then pass
			- [ ] else, check
			- [ ] Also, need full dataset
		- [ ] All test passing guys
			- MID 758: Yellow light
			- Mid 2771984 and
			- Mid 247297 have lots of hardware and no consumables
			- 848927 no consumables
			- Certify the good ones with mids and automation + allison
		- IF consumables standalone + OEM = 0, yellow flag
		- [ ] Check childrens hospital of wisconsin for 0 beds/procedures
	- [x] programmatize Allison's Tests
		- [ ] Some Tests causing dups, do a check after every add on refactor
		- [ ] Do a data refresh
		- Observations/Notes/Questions
			- How to update?
			- Go over 200?
			- Jing said Install Base OEM to start?
				- OEM
			- Other useful metrics
				- OEM and Standalone 0
				- How many Cust_NM or CUST_MID in both install bases?
		- [x] Test 1: Consumables Match
			- I added last 12 months consumables. What should that match to?
			- Use 'Audit files for test cases 6.4.24' file
			- [ ] use fiscal_rel_month = 12
			- [ ] needs to = only mdt, not OEM
			- [ ] will prob need test 1a/1b to include OEM
		- [x] Test 2: Other Customers
			- I did a basic check for the first word of the Title. If there is nothing else it passes, else it says to "Check". Not red flag, just yellow or orange.
			- [x] First Element + City + State, then
		- [ ] Test 3: OEM Match
			- [ ] OEM Name vs MID name, do fuzzy match with high percentage
			- [ ] OEM names largely incomplete, will just have to rely on test 6
			- What needs to be matched?
		- [x] Test 4: Install Base check
			- [x] Allison will provide me alternate source to match from
			- [x] Get cust ID and join comparing the cols
		- [ ] Test 5: IDN Level ??
			- [ ] Check for word logistics at IDN level
			- [ ] If cust_typ column is IDNSC - Self dist Regl, will fail
			- [ ] If there is a customer whose name matches idn name, but there are multiple idn names under it, (atlantic somethign but ton of medical centers)
		- [x] Test 6: Mid Name Clean
			- [ ] Has 3 basic checks
				- [ ] Does it have blocked
				- [ ] Does it have a number in it (but not VA)
				- [ ] Is it only one word
			- [ ] Check for "Duplicate", taken from glbl_main?
		- [ ] Test 7: Check MID address
			- Same as test 3 and 
			- Same as test 3, what is best source. I can match exactly or fuzzy with high threshold
			- Propose changing these to Test 6a and 6b
		- [x] Test 8: Beds and procedures (8a and 8b?)
			- Note: SDS Table is empty for procedures, so only checks beds
			- Doesn't really apply to non-hospitals. Are we filtering those?
			- [x] sds_dhc_overview in SDS_MAIN
			- [x] Take hospital_ID, number_beds, 
			- [x] Query from last wednesday
		- [ ] Test 9: Reasonable Calcs (a b c d)
			- No negatives, not over 100 for the percentage,
			- ratio should be not too much more than 1.0
			- Allison notes
				- sedation consumables cannot be more than 100%
				- if sedation vs procedure % is above 100, needs a check
				- Check zero, check negatives
				- if IB/Bed is above 1.25, needs a check
				- usage rate: if above 50 cons/socket/mo, flag it
		- Come up with score based on criteria
		- Other useful metrics
		- How to update?
			- replace sedation percentages, with total consumables, then when you hover you will see direct consumables vs philips consumables
			- 
- standalone = any hardware where 
- targeting list
	- anything over 110%
	- monthly socket utilization: anything over 100 is unreliable
		- can go to anything over 50 even if needed
	- See what customer amounts are after that
