### Questions/Survey
- What does this group for you?
- How important is it in your everyday life?
- What do you get out of this?
- How affected would you be (out of 10, out of 100, in your own words, whatever) if it were to go away tomorrow?
- Would this group be functionally different for you if it were downsized to something like a group text, or a free server without the archiving, such as discord or telegram?
- Is this just another group chat, another thing to click on like the other socials or group texts, or is it more (to you, be honest and specific as possible)?
- How many of the group have you physically visited? 
- Do the others feel like your friends? Or just my friends? Do you feel like this can improve over time or is it basically static?
- Do you want to just keep this movies indefinitely? Or should we consider switching to other mediums even if movies is admittedly very comfortable?
- What should be done differently?ins
- What is the most important aspect? AKA what can you absolutely not do without, if you had to choose just one (or at most 2-3) things.
- What is your least favorite thing, or something you feel very strongly should change?
- Should we add more people? Assume we figure out the implementation details and all agree.

### How I feel
- I don't have any other social interaction. Lisa's family are nice but I have no connection. My sisters are absent. I don't have parents.  I don't have another friend group.
- 5 year anniversary
- I am interested in creating something incredible. (It is currently good to great).
- I am interested in understanding, not argument.
- I am interested in helping others.
- I am extremely sad at how I am seemingly being perceived over and over. 
- This is not just an external problem, but it has to be fixed or else I can't continue.
- I am committed to visiting more of you in person.
- I want Roth's get together, or the concert. I want to be part of Will's travel plans. I want to go to Ben's parties and for Bo to have sleepovers. I want to be a Stephen and Cindy vacation destination, or meet them there. I want to be available to help Al move.
- My goals relevant to this
	- Have more in person. Going to do Brightline to visit Tampa and Orlando. Going to do the Eclipse. We need to plan a trip
	- Consider scaling back the group to whatever is closer to what you guys are comfortable with, and finding a different outlet for what my needs are, or continuing to put time into this. Decision time. 
	- Personal goals important to me
		- Health (weight, fitness, stretching, bjj)
		- Publish novel (online and in print)
		- Coding
			- Look for other dev opportunities, or set a date for leaving indefinitely
		- Location long term
			- Visit places, confer with friends, make decision
		- Side hustle (Woodworking idea, not scalable but high margins)
- Where I've dropped the ball
	- Can't help mike with his idea of the podcast/football, gotta drop it
	- Wasn't there for Will to start the year needing accountability. Also didn't ever follow up with him about the gambling or alcoholism/going to meetings. Did anyone else? Did you even feel like you could/should?
	- Didn't ask roth enough about his mom, still am not. Still haven't visited him. Haven't supported him enough for him to feel comfortable about the religious stuff.
	- Ben very clearly was in the best position, but also has the personality to try and manifest the kind of reality that he wants as far as social groups. He basically visited all of us, and yes his job helps with that, but he also put in the work. Also any time any kind of other get together was mentioned, he was the first to sign up.
	- Now, that isn't there. You can say it's his new job and being sr and lots of other things, but to me him talking about moving to a neighborhood with other parents and having parties and sleepovers and all of that stuff is clearly him putting the energy he was towards us, and putting it in that direction instead. And it's been fruitful! Maybe one can do both, maybe he would disagree with this, but to me it's clear as day that this is at least partly a "I am doing this here now because I was not getting it previously (aka trying with us)"
	-  Al should have had a couple of us help him move for the weekend.  He would never ask, and not all of us are in the practical situation to make it happen, but pooling resources we definitely should have. But, the buck stops with me and I needed to be first one to volunteer, well ahead of time.
	- I have failed myself in that I have not adhered to what I know to be the best ways to manifest what I want. I will refocus and do my absolute best to hold true to it now.
- I don't need another group chat. I don't need acquaintances. I can get the same basically anywhere, and believe it or not, so can you. I'm building something greater. I need your help. I need you to buy into that, at least partially, while still being skeptical as makes sense. 


### Steps
- Reduce channels/archive old ones?
- Add more people beginning this summer?
- Yearly get together. 2 people selected to organize and come up with a plan, and present it to the group. This year might be out but should we try? This would be something you tell your spouse/so is non-negotiable and very important, not just whatever.  Would this be helpful/interesting, or more of a burden than anything?
