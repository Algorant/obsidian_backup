### The House

[[MC]] awoke in a room he did not recognize. It was dark out, he could tell from the window and the desk lamp on in the room.  He turned to see [[LI]] there, in a recliner nearby.  "Oh good, you're up." she said as she got up and went to a nearby counter to pour a glass of water.  She came back and handed it to [[MC]].

"Thanks. Where are we?" he asked.  "My house, this is my room."  He looked around again with this knowledge. Oh okay. There wasn't anything really "girly" about it, but once he looked for it he could see it.  He averted his eyes once he found the bras and underwear hanging on a chair, and tried to not choke on the water.  It was nice and cold but with no ice, the way he liked best.

"So...what happened?" he asked finally.  Even though most of it was currently also coming back to him in a rush. He felt the pangs of thinking about uncle [[Rod]] being gone, [[George]] and his dad, and he assumed [[Rubin]] as well.  There was no way he made it out of the arcade if that thing had been in there with them and he had headed towards it. Not to mention all those people, the ones just enjoying a day off at the mall, the brave ones who stood up to that evil thing when there was no alternative. So much needless death.  [[MC]]s only experience with death so far in his life had been when his aunt [[Ruby]] had died.  He was too young when his parents had died to really have that count.

"The [[Zig]] took your pendant, then must have knocked you out somehow. I found you behind one of those fake Greek columns that got knocked down in the mayhem."  

"The [[Zig]]? Why is it called that?" 

"Their real name is not pronounceable by human mouths, it's too alien and abstract. That's just a name I came up with to call them, and to differentiate them from the [[Zag]]."

"The what?" [[MC]] thought for a moment. "Oh, that golden thing.  Are they like the sworn enemy of whatever that thing...-the [[Zig]], was?"

[[LI]] nodded.  "They were once part of the same species, but they had as I understand, irreconcilable differences at some point millions of years ago."

"I see. This should be a lot to take in, but for some reason, it feels alright.  Why did they want my pendant?"

"We still haven't figured that out.  [[Zag]] can explain to us everything they know about why the [[Zig]] seek out certain items  throughout the universe.  My understanding is that they are sort of like trophies, but perhaps there is more to it than that."

"So it killed all these people...[[George]]...my uncle, just for some kind of....I don't know...interdimensional scavenger hunt?"

"They are capable of doing that and much more. They don't think of other species the same way you or I do. There are certain ones they respect, but most of the other species in the galaxy, they hold with either some form of contempt or pity, maybe.  They have this set of beliefs around what they call [[The Principle]].  It seems tied to evolution some how, but more than that. Like the theory of evolution is something they hold as holy or to be revered. It's all very strange."

"How do you know all this? Where did they come from?"

"[[Zag]] told me most of it.  The rest I've just been kind of inferring as I go."  It was then that the door to the bedroom opened, and in came [[Rubin]].  "You're alive!!" exclaimed [[MC]].  At least someone was.  [[Rubin]] simply said "Indeed." in a matter-of-fact way, not really revealing much else by way of emotions.

"I'm really sorry about your uncle, [[MC]].  He died protecting you, and everyone else, from the [[Zig]]. He was a brave and wonderful man."  It was then that [[MC]] remembered all that weirdness with the gun and the keycard and all that.  [[LI]] seemed to infer what he was about to ask, must have read it on his face, and continued "I know it seems like he knew just as much as we did...do....but really, he didn't.  He just seemed like a man who needed very little information in order to make the right decisions."  That didn't quite sit well with [[MC]], but to be honest he still didn't really want to talk about it. It would mean referring to his uncle in the past tense, and, well, it was just a lot.

"So where is [[Zag]] now?" he asked instead.  This seemed to surprise [[LI]], who looked up at him and narrowed her eyes a little bit.  By way of explanation, [[Rubin]] opened one of the two other doors in the room, revealing a typical closet.  It was dark and at first all [[MC]] could see was a typical rod with a bunch of clothes hanging from various multicolored dollar store hooks.  But then, as he moved his gaze downward, he noticed that now-familiar glow.  It ebbed and flowed, seemingly in a natural rhythm, almost like breathing.

"Alright, so they're asleep or resting or something, I'm assuming.  What about the other thing. The [[Zig]]. I remember [[George]]s dad saying something about it being de something'd, and then that it would need to rest from using too much energy, or something."  [[LI]] seemed legitimately surprised for a second time in as many moments.  "What?" asked [[MC]], finally. "Nothing it's just....I didn't think you would put all that together.  [[Zag]] should be waking up again in a few hours. I will let them explain things.  For now, I think you should try and get some more rest.  We are gonna make a plan to stop that thing, and follow through on it tomorrow."

I guess I can try, thought [[MC]].  He was very doubtful he was going to be able to go back to sleep after getting amped up from finally getting some answer of what was going on, not to mention the incredible heartbreak he was probably still in denial about, but was likely to hit like a ton of bricks sometime very soon.  He finished gulping down the rest of the water, and was out as soon as he hit the pillow.

---

When he woke, it was still dark out, but the clock on the nightstand read 5:36 so it must be near dawn.  The room was dark but not completely, there was some light coming from somewhere. He realized that it was from the being he now knew to be [[Zag]].  He assumed it's name was also something incomprehensible, but it would definitely ask it when it had the chance.  He still couldn't really tell if it was awake. It didn't have any discernable features, it was just kind of a semi-uniform blob on the floor. 

<That is correct.  You would not be able to pronounce it. Over the eons our people have had many names.  This [[Zag]] is no different.  Perhaps a tad irreverent, but no matter.>  [[MC]] knew that this was obviously [[Zag]] communicating with him, but there was definitely no sound coming from the golden blob.  So this was...in his head? <Yes. I am communicating with your mind directly. It is not so different from what your kind calls telepathy in its imaginative stories, however to me it is more like a direct connection. I am manipulating the natural laws of the universe in order to do this. There is no magic or anything supernatural about it.>

<Alright, thought [[MC]].  So it works both ways? I can uh...think back to you and you receive it?>

<Yes. Correct.>

<Alright cool. So can you like....read *all* my thoughts? Or just what I am sending to you like this? That could get embarass- > 

<If you are asking whether I am able to discern through this connection whether or not I can recognize your level of sexual attraction to [[LI]], the answer is no I cannot. That would require a more direct interfacing with your mind.  That fact is obvious from many other signals I can detect, however.>

<Oh ok thanks, thats reassuring.> [[MC]] could feel himself getting a tad red, but he tried his best to ignore it. This was too cool and weird to worry about that too much.

<How old are you? How old is [[Zig]]>

<Our species processes time differently than yours does. Further, our life cycles are much longer than the vast majority of species in this galaxy.  We are perhaps one of the earliest creatures bestowed by [[The Principle]] with sentience. Needless to say I am several of your millennia old.  Our research suggests that [[Zig]] is considerably younger than I am, though still they have existed in their present form for hundreds of your years.  In fact, from the perspective of one such as I, [[Zig]] would be considered quite juvenile, not so different from your concept of teenager.>

<Wow. Why did he..they..? Why did it come to Earth?  [[LI]] mentioned something about my pendant and said that you might be able to elaborate what makes it so interesting to creatures as powerful as yourselves.>

<The organization of [[Zig]]s civilization differs greatly from when the schism happened between myself and the ones who believe as I do, and separated, and the ones who remained.

<What caused the schism? Can you explain it to me?>

<Our species has the unique ability to...link with other species, granted that they are of a minimum size and general intelligence.  Our Self links with what we call the Host, in a process not so different from your planet's various parasitic species.  We are able to fully control all of the mental capacity of the Host, and use their body and all inherited traits/skills/benefits as if they were our own.  The longer we inhabit a host body, the longer we remain connected, the stronger the connections between the two life forms becomes.  In the ideal case, we call this process Unity in its most mature form.  At that point, once one of our kind has attached to a host for a very long time, we become as close to one entity as a human would be considered one entity between their body and their brain.

Our species originally considered Unity to be an admirable goal, something to strive for and ultimately achieve for most of our Selves.  With that, ultimately, came the necessity to create what would be considered certain rules or guidelines that dictate what forms of life are suitable for being Hosts or not.  One main group of us believed that, as much as possible, the choice of attachment should lie with the Host.  In other words, it should be a voluntary action.  The Host should give their body willingly.  We believe that these guidelines are in line with what [[The Principle]] would want to happen between it's creations, and would respect the great responsibility such a gift deserves, having been bestowed upon Us.>

<The other group, the one that [[Zig]] belongs to, believes that [[The Principle]] gave us this gift for us to use as we please.  That other species are by definition lesser, and we do not need their permission or willingness in order have them as Host.  It is a conqueror's mentality.  Over time, this fundamental disagreement became the focal point of the entire society and organizational structure.  It began to affect many other aspects of our role in the universe.  Violence, torture, subjugation: all of it and worse became permissible if not outright desired by our people and it's ambitions. Our species went from being one of the brightest in the galaxy, to one that brings only darkness wherever it goes.  My group was eventually forced into exile, after many years.  We try to keep to the old ways, and attempt to stop or undo the harmful things our brothers do in service of what they think is their destiny.>

<Wow.  That is....a lot. I am sorry.>

<Yes. It is quite a predicament. I was sent here on such a mission, to prevent [[Zig]] from taking what they call [[The Objective]] and returning it to their society.  Unfortunately, the details of the specific why and how of the individual items the decide to seek out and obtain have been denied to our group for some time.  Perhaps when we neutralize [[Zig]] and take [[The Objective]] back, we can interrogate him.>

<Wow. We are gonna try to do that? Like...the four of us?>

<Yes. We have a plan. If we work together, it is possible.  I will have them explain, in more detail.  For now, I must conserve my energy for later today.>  It was then that [[MC]] realized that [[LI]] and [[Rubin]] were awake.  When he had asked that question, they had also looked at him.

<Wait....can you guys hear me too?> They both nodded.  <Whoa, and I can hear your thoughts too?> He got a < Yeah > and a <You got it, bud> simultaneously reverberating in his head.  It was easy to tell who was who, even if its not like they had different voices.  He could just tell.  The sun was now a good three-quarters over the horizon.

<So what's next?> [[MC]] asked the room?  

They proceeded to tell him a lot more things.  Apparently, [[Zig]] needed a way to leave the gravity well of Earth, he didn't have the power to do it on his own.  So that means, he was going to find the nearest rocket, and attempt to blast himself off with [[The Objective]], and rendezvous with....[[Zag]] had said something he did not understand, here.  They hadn't necessarily said there was a spaceship or any kind of craft up there waiting for it, just that it would be able to Return with whatever strange mechanism these beings used to traverse the galaxy. It kind of seemed like [[Zag]] was being obtuse on purpose, but [[MC]] wasn't sure.

Once [[Zig]] was done resting, ([[Zag]] said that for the amount of energy [[Zig]] had used, and their age, they would need considerably more time to recuperate than [[Zag]]....herself? ([[MC]] still wasn't sure on the gender thing for either of them.  But for some reason, [[Zig]] seemed male and [[Zag]] seemed female, so he went with that in his head)), he would be heading for the nearest place where he was certain there would be a rocket of appropriate strength to bring him out of Earth's orbit.

He would be headed to [[Houston Station]], and the plan was to already be there to stop him.

### Houston Station

The ride to the space station was one that [[MC]] had made many times. It was only maybe a 15-20 minute drive, depending on traffic.  Once aunt [[Ruby]] was gone, there were plenty of time thats [[Rod]] took him there while he had to work overtime to meet a deadline, or had some kind of work function after hours that he couldn't miss, and couldn't leave [[MC]] at home for.  Some of them were fun, like that summer where they did pizza and games nights. He wondered why that ended, but of course that led to him thinking about his uncle again, and...

He had learned a few more things.  [[Zig]] did not have many weaknesses, but the most important one was that, for their entire species, a certain range of frequencies rendered them fully incapacitated for a moment.  Something about interference with certain sensemaking abilities.  For humans it just sounded like an annoying high pitched tone.  They were kind of limited as far as what they could come up with that was portable and could output a sound like that.  [[LI]]s house had a few ancient personal tape recorders that she said were her [[Mom]]s like three careers ago.  They found a site that had that frequency, recorded it, and played it in a loop to each other until each tape recorder had a few hours of it nonstop.  There were two.  They had given one to [[MC]] and [[Rubin]] had the other.  The reason [[LI]] hadn't gotten one, is because she would be host for [[Zag]].

He had learned more about what that was like, as well. While they prepped, he asked all sorts of questions to both [[LI]] and [[Zag]] about what it was like, and what changed between them.  Needless to say, it was weird and fascinating.  [[Zag]] had the ability to take full  control over [[LI]], but she said that there were almost never times where that was necessary, and it was more optimal to allow [[LI]] to work together in controlling the body.  This had various synergistic effects, and further allowed [[Zag]] to be able to manipulate it's body (Shape, they seemed to call it, which makes sense as sometimes they didn't really have a body of any kind) independently and work in tandem with [[LI]] or any other host.

This brought up the second major weapon they had in the fight against [[Zig]]:  [[Zag]] herself.  The beams of light that he had seen being channeled by [[George]]s dad at the mall, had actually been [[Zag]] propelling minuscule bits of herself at the other alien.  Somehow they were able to supercharge particles and eject them out at relativistic speeds.  The only problem is that, in this scenario, that part of her was definitely lost forever, or at least as long as [[Zig]] was the enemy.  It would be able to, after the initial blast wore off, absorb those particles into itself as resources, once they cooled down to a certain temperature.  But, the initial kinetic energy could not be avoided or prevented easily, so it was still a much better deterrent than human ballistics like guns and even missiles.  [[Zag]] said that below a certain critical mass (or energy), no amount of bullets from any gun or rifle would do much damage to [[Zig]] if they were at all paying attention.  It had the ability to absorb the kinetic energy of such ballistics, even multiple at once, for a very long time using minimal energy.  [[MC]] had seen for himself just how useless even a bunch of gunfire directed at it had been.  Uncle [[Rod]]....

Further, [[Zag]] would be able to match any sort of improvised weapon that [[Zig]] could come up with.  She said that with her experience and wisdom, there would be nothing [[Zig]] could present as that would come as a surprise to her.  As long as she was focused and aware, her ability to dynamically stop anything [[Zig]] thought to throw at them would probably be their most important tool in the fight.

They had a plan to set everything up in different "zones", each one increasingly closer to the launch platform, and have various deterrents and obstacles set up ahead of time.  They would also figure something out, a pretend emergency, to try and evacuate as many people as possible from the area before things started to go down.  [[Zag]] estimated that they had at least a few hours before [[Zig]] would even....

As they approached the front gate, it was very clear that something was very wrong.  There was no gate.  [[MC]] could remember it being a big heavy thing that opened super slowly to one side, and only after you got clearance from the gate attendant, and there were always two armed officers nearby, just in case. (Just in case of what, [[MC]] always thought, who would be crazy enough to do anything here?)

Where the gate had been there now was just abnormally twisted pieces of metal, close to the ground rather than the ~6 feet high that normally existed.  There were no guards.  The guard shack, a small enclosure that basically had enough room for two people and some chairs, with a couple of windows so they could see who was coming and going, was also no more.  It wasn't destroyed or in pieces, it was completely missing.  All that was left was the concrete foundation that rose a few inches off of the ground, with some bolts that appeared to have held the shack down.  [[Rubin]] was driving [[LI]]s dad's pickup truck, with everyone saddled up in the front and only row.  Thankfully, [[Zag]] did not take up much space, as they were already Linked with [[LI]], and were hanging out on the back half of their body, like some giant golden remora.

[[Rubin]] slowed as they passed where the gate should be, and as they looked around, [[MC]] pointed at what he saw in the distance.  It was the guard shack, a good 500 feet from where it was supposed to be, on it's side.  [[MC]] couldn't see any people, per se, but he did see what looked like it could be an arm, or what was left of it, sticking out from under the destroyed shack, along with a gigantic pool of blood. Too much for it to have come from only one person.  It seemed like [[Zig]] was already here.  

They had no warning for when the large unknown object blindsided the back half of the truck and sent them all careening, end over end, while also rotating, like the way a snowboarder would do a trick off of a halfpipe that garnered all 10s.  [[MC]] could only detect that one moment he had been in the car, awake and taking in the situation, and the next he was on the ground, opening his eyes which had been closed, several feet away from the truck, which was now upside down and completely wrecked in several places.  [[LI]]-[[Zag]] was next to him, and for some reason had a firm grip on his left shoulder.  As they let go [[MC]] realized that they must have somehow jumped out of the car at the last second, and pulled [[MC]] along with them, leaving them relatively unscathed, save a few scrapes on [[MC]]s left elbow.

But as he got up and got a better look at the truck, he realized that [[Rubin]] was still inside.  All [[MC]] could see of him from here was his arm, curled up unnaturally and sticking out partially through the windshield, while the rest of his body hung limp, upside down, still attached with his seat-belt.  

< I was not able to push him out in time.  I am sorry.>

He had been a really cool dude. It was only just dawning on him the last conversation they had had at the shop, almost as if [[Rubin]] was hinting somehow at what was to come.  How had he known?  There wasn't much point in trying to figure that out right now.  He went to the truck and got to business.  [[LI]]-[[Zag]] helped him get the two tape recorders from the truck.  They had other stuff, but most of it had been contingent on them being able to set up and plan for [[Zig]]s arrival.

< We must go. I can hear the sounds that indicate a preliminary launch sequence has been activated. It will only be a matter of minutes before the rocket will be ready for takeoff.  Somehow he was able to have personnel here already getting everything prepared, likely by scheduling a test launch for this date several days ago. >

< I think uncle [[Rod]] had been talking about a launch coming up this week. > added [[MC]].  How were they ever going to be able to stop this? Everything was already ruined.  [[Rubin]] was dead.  Uncle [[Rod]] was dead.  Aunt [[Ruby]] was dead.  His parents were....

[[MC]] made himself snap out of it.  There was no point. All he could do was put one foot in front of the other, and take things one step at a time. That is what they would have wanted him to do. And so that was that.  Besides, he had one of the most badass aliens in the galaxy by his....

It was only by the quick reaction time of [[Zag]] that the Cherry red sedan that had been hurled at them, had not completely wiped them out.  Somehow, once again with no time to spare, [[Zag]] had created some kind of....shield? by extending a large circular concave shape outward from [[LI]]s arms, at an angle that redirected the car just enough so that it flew off with most of its energy into a nearby ditch.

So, it knew we were here, and it was hurtling fucking cars.  Cool. Cool cool cool, thought [[MC]]. This was insane.  < Come, this way. > Nearby there was a collection of stationary double wide trailers, as well as various shipping containers, which contained all sorts of different parts and materials that the Station was always and constantly ordering.  Sometimes [[Rod]] would bring [[MC]] out here when there was a delivery of something really specific he had been waiting for, say a giant new mainframe, or an additional terrestrial satellite that was going to replace one of the decommissioned ones that allowed "Houston" to be the "Houston" always contacted by astronauts on space missions.

They maneuvered in and out of the various trailers and containers, some even stacked on top of each other, with [[LI]]-[[Zag]] leading the way.  [[MC]] assumed she had some crazy alien way of either sensing where [[Zig]] was, or knew how to avoid detection. Either way, best that they take the lead.  He just listened to the voice in his head and did whatever they said, when they said it. This left no time to even be afraid, or to contemplate in earnest just exactly how stupid what he was doing was.  He was just a kid. What was he ever going to contribute here? Why was he even here?  < You have more power than you know.  We shall do this together. > is what he received. He tried to trust in that voice. It was all he had.

Eventually, after a time [[MC]] had trouble even estimating. It could have been hours for all he knew, they made it to the base of the main platform.  It was just one long elevator ride up to the top and that is where.



##### Notes
- Whats hosting like
- weaknesses to certain frequencies
- uses much more energy when not in host form
