#### [[Progress]] Day 2 Begin
##### School

[[MC]] woke to the sound of his uncle shouting him awake from downstairs. He looked at his watch. 7:52am.  Shit, he was late.  He got up from bed, threw on some clothes that were strewn about on the floor (he smelled the jeans in the crotch area first and thought, hmm good enough), a quick 20 second useless brush and three total minutes later he was downstairs wolfing down a quick breakfast.

"What did you stay up playing this time?" asked uncle [[Rod]], as I stuffed the rest of the bacon he made for me into my mouth. "TFa Fing" #edit he said, realizing halfway that he would not be understood.  He swallowed first, drank the rest of his water while [[Rod]] waited patiently for attempt # 2, and said "I decided to watch The Thing like you said. You're right, the original is way better."

[[Rod]] smiled knowingly. He didn't have to do any kind of parental I told you so, and [[MC]] didn't need to receive it. They shared this together. They had an understanding. [[MC]] didn't know if other families had this, but he was definitely grateful for it after everything he'd been through.  He peered at his watch while picking up his backpack where he'd left it the night before after coming home late.  Homework. Whoops. He would finish history during math...and skip lunch so he could do his AP Chem...7:58. Fuck.  He started to come up with decent excuses to say in homeroom.

He looked at his uncle pleadingly as he did so. "You're lucky I don't have anything else to do this morning, traffic'll be crazy getting to the Center anyway. Come on, let's go." As he reached for his keys.

The got into his nondescript sedan. You can sometimes tell a lot about a person by what they drive, or more accurately for [[Rod]], what they decide not to. He did well for himself as a staff engineer for [[Johnson Space Center]]. But you wouldn't be able to tell unless you engaged him in a conversation he actually found interesting. [[MC]] never had trouble with this, but he had seen countless other people around town who did.  More accurately, it can be said that it was [[Rod]]'s trouble, but [[MC]] was largely the same way, so instead it built up even more of the aforementioned rapport.

They turned onto the street #edit (name this) that the high school was on #edit (name this too), when something uncanny in [[MC]]s line of sight made him shudder.  He focused on what it could have been, squinted, but all he saw was another of the same kind of cookie cutter houses that lined the entire neighborhood. This one happened to be a particular shade of yellow. Marigold, they call it, he thought. But other than that there was nothing out of the ordinary about it. A newer looking pickup truck in the driveway, other kids walking past on the sidewalk soon to join [[MC]] in their formal education.

But it was off. Something was off. [[MC]] couldn't shake that pang of dread he initially felt, even though it had only lasted an instant and then subsided. He instinctually clutched the pendant his aunt [[Ruby]] gave him the day after they had taken him in. After the accident.  "Everything alright?" Uncle [[Rod]] had been talking about something, [[MC]] hadn't really been paying attention, but he noticed the lack of uh huh's and mmms from [[MC]].  He looked at his watch. 8:07. Not too bad, he still had plausible deniability if he hurried. "Yep! Sorry all good just zoned out. This is good here, thanks so much Unc love you bye." [[Rod]] barely had time to slow the car down from school zone speed before [[MC]] barreled out like he usually did.  Oh well, he could try to ease into bringing up [[Ruby]] again another time. The therapist said it would be good for both of them.

There weren't any launches until next week, and he'd already turned in all his deliverables, so it'd be a slow day at work. He busied himself mentally doing some pseudocode and refactoring, while wading through all the walking kids with their backpacks and soccer moms in their vans. Another time, [[Rod]].

[[MC]] rolled into homeroom approximately 27 seconds after 8:10. Not everyone was in their seats yet, and Mr Cooper was turned away from him talking to Angela. In the clear. He wouldn't even have to insinuate that he had an emergency number 2 prior to arriving. There weren't assigned seats, but anyone whos been to high school knows that there still kinda are. So he went to his seat and tried to come up with a plan for how to tackle the 3 classes worth of homework he never got to last night. 

He really needed to stop doing that, but honestly it wasn't so bad. [[MC]] had the mentality that if you really wanted to do something irresponsible instead of what you were supposed to do, as long as it wasn't like killing someone, you should do what you want to do and then be prepared to deal with the consequences.  Welp, here they were.  Alright, he would do some chemistry now during the morning announcements and through most of Mr Cooper's lecture, then stop for the totally predicable pop quiz that would come two-thirds of the way through. 

He got everything ready and started balancing the titrations. Not difficult at all, this was basically review. Mrs Mezcla had warned us that the next sections would be quite a bit tougher, but so far so good. He was almost done with the second to last one when his mechanical pencil ran out of lead. ...He then also realized all his refills were still at home on his desk, still in their Office Depot bag from when [[Rod]] had bought them  for him last week. Ugh. He started to think about who he could annoy to borrow a spare pencil or pen when he felt a sharp poke on his left shoulder.

He turned to see [[LI]] had just basically stabbed him with a black bic similar to his, except it used 0.7mm lead instead of his preferred 0.5. Whatever, it'd get the job done. [[LI]] and him were friends, but not close. She was pretty and popular, and he was just whatever. But they had a few things in common and had some good conversations in the past, usually about movies or books. They were both into #edit ambos sci-fi and fantasy pretty equally, and had seen all the major flicks in both genres, but on reading their counterparts they were split, he was all over the fantasy whereas she ran circles around him on the science fiction front. Heinlein and Vonnegut had multiple reads for her, whereas he had only read one or two from each of them, despite liking them a lot.

"Thanks.." he mouthed, and turned around before Mr Cooper could single him out and ask him to use the oxford comma in an example sentence. He finished the problem he was on and was looking over the final one when he heard "Ok, who's ready for a pop quiz!?" out of the corner of the part of him that could multitask in some capacity. He looked up just in time to see the teacher do his patented rubbing together of his hands. As he put away the homework and took out a notebook, he figured he could fake having answered it quickly right before class by putting in some gobbledygook that looked plausible. Nice! This day was going well so far, despite the weird moment in the morning. He reached for the pendant once again, without even realizing it. The moment was gone before he could really reflect on exactly what had happened, and he focused on doing his best to get his typical B+ on this quiz coming up.

Lunch was uneventful. [[MC]] grabbed a candy bar from the vending machine and went to one of his usual tables. His friend George stopped by briefly to show him some of the draws he got out of the new expansion pack for the latest trading card game he was playing. [[MC]] could nerd out like the best of them, but he wasn't currently into those. He mostly played video games and read comics to satiate that particular need. In fact, when George realized [[MC]] was only half paying attention in the way you don't mention to friends but just acknowledge and give them space, he started getting up and just said "You coming today?" as he did a couple times a week. "Yeah, I'll be there." he muttered and went back to getting his history outline out. The Spanish Civil War....fascinating. Except unlike most teenagers, [[MC]] kinda meant it when he said that. Learning new things had almost always come easy to him, easier than most kids. This seems to have the unfortunate downside of him never really having to try very hard at much of anything in school in order to do well.  "Thats way above your pay grade, Myc, just get this outline done..." and so he did.

The final bell rang, and one could feel the collective sigh of relief from the humans in the school desks (the teacher always has this same feeling, internally, even if never shown to the students lest they utterly destroy them for it) #edit as everyone begins to pack up. [[MC]] does a mental recap of how the day went, and how much he can get away with not doing until tomorrow, so he can go to the shop and dick around like usual.  

He packed up his stuff, waved bye to [[LI]] and gave some see-ya-laters to the typical polloi and rushed out the door. As he packed up the super unnecessary stuff into his locker to separate from the regular unnecessary stuff that stayed in his backpack, he realized that [[Rod]] had given him a ride this morning. Meaning, he didn't have his bike. Meaning, he'd have to walk to the shop.  Ugh, that would get rid of a good 40 minutes of time he could spend doing the typically useless stuff he did for fun, not to mention having to leave early to walk home, as well. Maybe he'd try taking the bus again....
 
##### The Shop

[[The Comic Shop]] was actually pretty cool, as far as he was concerned. Yeah the name was stupid, but what names weren't at the end of the day. His wasn't much better.

#### [[Progress]] Day 3: Begin

No idea what his parents were thinking, even after he looked up the etymology and biblical origins #edit (make sure its Mycah). As he walked in through the familiar front door and was greeted with that familiar smell, of slightly musty, cheaply manufactured (yet often beautifully inked) paper. Even though comics were probably not even in the first half dozen money makers for the shop, well below trading card games, board games, video games, and even the makeshift snack bar. Hell, even the modest selection of miniatures and action figures, most collecting dust on the various shelves probably took in a rivaling amount as the eponymous items.  

[[MC]] himself wasn't even really into them. Sure, he'd read his share of one offs like Alan Moore's joints, or the really really top shelf stuff like Frank Miller Batman, but in general he spent most of his days on games and movies, when he wasn't reading books.  Oh, and talking to [[Rubin]], of course.  The shop manager, who had been around since [[MC]] or anyone else knew, was one of the main attractions of the place. The dude definitely knew his stuff, was opinionated, but didn't force it on you or act holier than thou about it, as you might expect.  

[[MC]] was pretty sure he didn't own the shop, but as to who did it was anybody's guess. That's the kind of things that didn't matter, for all intents and purposes, and even if it did, [[MC]] wouldn't be one of the people who would be affected by it one way or another. Anyway, [[Rubin]] was tall, with a long ponytail not long for this world, if the receding line on top of his head was any indication. On that front he basically matched the stereotype, but that was thankfully where they mostly ended. [[Rubin]] was a nice, open minded dude. 

He actually listened to annoying kids like [[MC]] and [[George]], even though he definitely didn't have to. Being one of the only games in town, he would have gotten our money all the same. But yeah, he wasn't a dick, and conversations with him were always interesting in the way that they usually were not with other adults. He liked the same stuff, and was always willing to recommend stuff adjacent to what he saw you buy, or that he thought you'd like. He was better than any recommendation engine you could find online or lengthy google search for that kind of thing, that was for sure. [[MC]] and the others of similar persuasion were lucky to have him in their little suburb of a suburb of a town.

[[MC]] saw [[George]] and the other TCG heads in their usual corner, no doubt setting up another round of the new expansion pack for the game [[George]] was telling [[MC]] about at lunch earlier, but that he already forgot the name of.  He looked around the rest of the shop. A couple people browsing the shelves, a few younger kids in the pokemon and yu-gi-oh area, and the fighting game dudes in front of an old CRT playing some Melee. [[MC]] had a decent Jigglypuff, but never really played the game competitively. It was just so satisfying nailing people with Rest and getting that beautiful home run sound as they are hurtled off the screen.

Anyway, he wasn't here for any of that today. In fact, he wasn't really sure what he was there for today. Then he remembered, [[Rubin]] said he had something for him and to stop by today. He found him at the back end of the long counter, with long rows and rows of colorful things in glass enclosures. He seemed to be with a customer, so [[MC]] hung back for a minute and pretended to be interested in one of the vintage [[Spawn]] figurines. One of them was this hideous clown which didn't seem to fit with what little he knew about this particular hero.

Even with the understanding that eavesdropping is some kind of social taboo, [[MC]] couldn't help but begin to understand what the customer and [[Rubin]] were talking about. He could see [[Rubin]] was pretty animated, so the subject was most likely interesting to him, too. "You see, [[Venom]] has a some sort of moral backbone, or maybe it's that he begins to love humans, or maybe just his host.  But Carnage....man Carnage is a whole 'nother thing.'"

Ah ok, the Symbiotes from Spider-Man. He was definitely into those. In [[MC]]s mind they fell into a particular form of villain that always seemed to have to be nerfed in some way, lest they quickly just overpower or murder everything in their path including whoever the hero of the story is supposed to be. Carnage seems like a particularly important example. The dude makes axes for hands, and yet Spider-Man in general isn't really that gory of a comic, so it's kind of wasted using innuendo and insinuation.  The liquid-metal T-1000 from Terminator 2 is more like what he should be like, except if it had the personality of a serial killer instead of just some dumb machine from the future with one singular purpose.

"Yeah..give Black, White, and Blood #1 a shot and let me know what you think. If you dig it, shoot me an email and I'll put the other ones on order for you and have them for you here in 2-3 days. They're not exactly rare, but not that easy to find, either. I know a guy. A few actually..." [[Rubin]] was nothing if not enthusiastic about his job.  As he rang the customer up, [[MC]] busied himself checking out some of the new expansions for *Settler's of Catan* he wasn't familiar with, followed by a few of the new Legacy verisons of the classic games. Seems like they came out with a legacy version of *Monopoly* now. He wondered what interesting mechanics could be introduced for a game like that. It didn't make sense to him in the way something like *Risk*.

"What could that possibly add to it, am I right?" [[Rubin]] appeared behind him without him noticing. It was not the first time it seemed like he was able to read his mind. "Yeah, they seem to kind of just be milking the brand at this point. The first couple were definitely cool, though. *Pandemic* especially. You played that one?" [[MC]] shook his head, he knew the basic rules though, and liked that kind of game where everyone had to work together to win, rather than being pitted against one another.  Co-op games always had their own special flavor going on, especially when done well. He much preferred it to versus mechanics.

"So how'd you like the movie?" he asked. For a second, [[MC]] didn't know what he was talking about, then he remembered it was actually a conversation with [[Rubin]] that got him interested in watching the 1982 version of *The Thing*. "I didn't wanna spoil that it is actually a chronological sequel to the modern one. Surprise!" he smiled.  He not already knew I had watched it, but knew I'd agree with what he just said, too. One day I'd ask him how he did that particular magic trick so often....

"Yeah." was all I managed when I realized I hadn't responded to him in a normal amount of time. He didn't seem to mind.

"I definitely liked the tone better, they captured what it would be like a tad better too.  It didn't feel dated like some other movies I've seen from that time, at least nowhere near as much. Probably a sign of quality." [[Rubin]] nodded sagely, as if he already knew that too. "So how do you think he fits in the greater conversation we've been having? You seem to have an interest in this archetype of villain." It's true, he did. He couldn't help but be constantly ranking things he found similar in his head. Some of his friends had told him it was kind of bad form, and even uncle [[Rod]] had insinuated once or twice, that even though he personally didn't mind, it was probably not ok to share some of these, if they in any way could offend someone who doesn't feel the same about hierarchies.

"I overheard you talking about [[Carnage]]. He's gotta be near the top, for obvious reasons. Then I think it's something like the [[T1000]], and after that are things like [[The Thing]], or like the monster in [[IT]]. I think they are third place at best."  [[Rubin]] nodded again, pensively.  "Alright cool. And have you put any thought into how you'd deal with them? We do have a rich corpus to draw from with [[Carnage]], with [[Spidey]] and [[Venom]]'s many encounters, but something like the [[T1000]], what do you think?"

"I don't think a normal person dealing with any of these things is realistic. I know I would have no chance against one. I think its a little hubristic to even ponder much about it." 

"Alright, but.....gun to your head? Rank em in terms of how difficult they'd be to defeat." That [[MC]] could do. He took a second. "Okay, I think 'easiest' would be something like the [[T1000]]. It seemed relentless in pursuit, but at the end of the day it was susceptible to the weaknesses that we at least assume are programmed into machines.  I'd do my best to try and figure out a situation thats easy for humans to deal with,  but difficult for a machine. Hopefully that would translate even into a hyper-advanced one like this. I just need to find the right kind of problem, I guess."

"Nice, ok. And next?"

"Next, in ascending order I guess is how we're going, would be [[Pennywise]] for sure. He seems to have a weakness not only for kids but for typical horror movie trope type stuff as well. If all bets are off on that front, like if I was writing the book, he'd just easily kill everyone, but if we are working within some kind of trope-o-sphere, then I'd figure out a way to outsmart him."

"Alright, now the hard part..."

"Yeah. Honestly for the [[Symbiote]], I don't really know.. I guess we do have the typical corpus to draw from, but I don't have Peter Parker or Eddie Brock's abilities, let alone their counterparts. I'm just a kid. It seems basically hopeless, especially if they are after you in particular for whatever reason. I'm punting on this one. It's the hardest. [[Carnage]] is one of the scariest villains I could possible imagine."

"I mean...what about Claything/Clayface in [[Batman]], he seems to do okay against him, no?"

"Well it's the same kind of problem, me being a kid is different from being frickin' [[Bruce Wayne]], right?  And on top of that, at least of the versions I've seen, [[Clayface]] has personality flaws that always seem to do him in, just like a most of the [[Batman]] villains. Definitely a cool angle and it's great the way they do it, but it's just a different thing. If you have no human connection to this thing....if it's completely alien, you can't rely on any of that. Not to mention that even if you did, it's got that added angle of wanting to feed on their host's energy....Hmm.."

This caused [[MC]] to pause for a bit. [[Rubin]] seemed to already know it was coming, of course, so he was content to wait it out, listening with a smile on his face, but beginning to busy himself with some other task in the shop that needed to get done while [[MC]] pondered.

"Okay....so the parasitic nature of the thing is it's obvious weakness. I guess you have to figure out a way to remove it from the host, and then it gets significantly easier. Easier said than done, ofc, but at least its not entirely hopeless.  Once you do that, you contain it, and then figure out how to yeet that fucker back into space. There would be no containment safe enough on Earth that I would trust to house that thing."

"Nice! Okay. So not *completely* hopeless. We skipped one, though."

[[MC]] thought again. Oh yeah. He had skipped [[The Thing]].  Not deliberate, just got caught up in the excitement of the conversation, I guess. He didn't get to have these conversations with adults, and his friends were ok some of the time I guess, but it wasn't the same.  It was usually both of them speaking from a relationship of ignorance, or just talking shit, versus having a dialogue with someone with actual wisdom. [[MC]] benefited much more from conversations with that, and he was constantly puzzled why people seemed to at least in their preferences, lean towards just talking amongst equally ignorant peers so often...

He realized he was taking too long to answer again.  "Oh right, [[The Thing]]. Okay. I actually had a question about that one. So in your opinion, does it just have the ability to shapeshift and create immaculate replicas of things it takes in? Or is there always some kind of tell?"

"Well, the movies both seem to insinuate that its really hard to tell visually, but you can use the tried-and-true 'tell me something only you would know', and that seems to work well."

"Yeah. Typical doppelganger type situations make it seem easy like people just have these at arm's reach, but that would be kinda hard on the spot to think of. Like, what if you were the thing? What would you say that only you and me would know?"

"Great question. It's probably not as easy as the movie makes it out to be. I haven't read the book, maybe it goes into more detail...So generally though, it would fall somewhere inbetween?"

[[MC]] mentally scanned the facts one last time. "Yeah. Not as scary as [[Carnage]], but pretty close. Definitely above the [[Terminator]] and [[Pennywise]], with the caveat like I said before that this is generally kind of a doomed exercise realistically, and I'd have little to slim chance with any of these."

"Okay fair enough. And have you ever thought what it would be like if there was a villain that could both takeover a host, as well has have the shapeshift ability as a completely separate power? Does that amplify their powers, or are they about the same level, cancel each other out kinda thing?"

[[MC]] frowned. [[Rubin]] was always really good at these. He made others think in fun, orthogonal ways that took people out of their comfort zone. Even within the crazy world of comic books he was pretty good about it. This wasn't some prep-time-batman stack rank, it took some brainpower to even get a framework going to be able to answer.  [[MC]] began his.

"Hmm....I think they pair well together, and cover each others' weaknesses. I could definitely see a bad guy that could do both. Surely there's been something analogous before in the corpus. I'm having a tough time thinking of one, but ok let me see....yeah, a creature with both of these would be really, really bad. I'm putting my chance at defeating them at near 0%."

"So they would be at the top of the list? Yeah, sounds about right. A scary proposition."

"Wheres this question coming from.  You gonna reveal your secret?" [[Rubin]] smiled. He seldom did, but one might as well ask.  He was of the school that its much more rewarding if one reaches the conclusion by themselves, or with as little assistance as possible. Aggravating in the moment, but [[MC]] had to agree it did have it's appeal. Once you did figure out what he was getting at, it did feel kinda good. One of his many magic tricks.

George was seemingly done with his latest game and coming over to take a break.  "Hey man, what can I getcha?" asked [[Rubin]], the conversation winding to a temporary pause, and anyones guess when it would return.  George ordered his typical energy drink and slim jims. "So what were you guys talking about?" he asked right before taking a swig.  [[Rubin]] drifted off to help another customer. He was on his own.  He liked George plenty, but these kinds of conversation were just not that interesting with him. He was too matter of factual with it. Anything outside his comfort zone he'd just parrot things anyone could read out of any manual or Wikipedia entry. Uninteresting. It wasn't his fault, exactly, but [[MC]] just didn't really get anything out of it. He had to say something, though.

"We were ranking powerful shapeshifters and dopplegangers in comics and movies and stuff." he said finally.

"Oh, cool! You mean like the [[animagus]] in Harry Potter, right? Yeah they are kinda cool. Or I guess when they take stuff like the polyjuice potion. Those are some of my favorite parts of the series."

Ugh. George also wasn't much of a reader, outside of incidental lore from theorycrafting decks for TCGs, which he was admittedly very good at, there wasn't much going on in the literature department.  Sometimes it was like having a film conversation with someone who only watched movie trailers. [[MC]] decided to engage, though. There was no hurt in being polite and giving them a chance or two. "Yeah, like that sorta. We were more focused on the villains that can do that kinda stuff. Like the T1000 in terminator."

"The robot? 'I'll be back...'" he intoned in the terrible way everyone could vaguely do a certain muscular Austrian. "I guess terminator kinda looks real, but wouldn't you see the machine under after a while, or hear them say something weird?" [[MC]] already regretted this, but they'd already started, and he didn't really have an easy out. "No like...have you seen the second movie? There's a terminator that's like....liquid. It can turn into anything its not just a robot."

"Oh sorry, I don't know much about the movies tbh. My parents don't really like me watching them..." Fair enough, thought [[MC]]. It wasn't George's fault, he was being friendly and trying his best. He decided to change tacks "Oh alright. So what deck did you just use, wanna tell me about it?"

George instantly beamed, and began animatedly reaching for his protection sleeves, no doubt about to go on for a good hour and a half about all the permutations and a detailed play-by-play of everything that just happened in his latest best 2-outta-3.  Even if it wasn't [[MC]]'s favorite thing in the world, it was fine enough for killing some time. He looked over one last time at [[Rubin]], who winked at him knowingly, before they went over to the table to talk about all things mythically cardboardical...

It was pretty late by the time [[MC]] was able to disentangle himself from the veritable dissertation on the benefits of playing monopurple *this* over anything bi- or tri- *that*. [[MC]] was fortunate enough that he found just about anything interesting, an could keep up with a conversation and ask questions where the interlocution partner could know he was really listening and taking everything in, but man, that was enough for an entire month if not longer for that subject. 

The shop was closing up, when its about that time [[Rubin]] lets everyone know by turning off half the lights in the back part of the open floorplan shop.  It was dark out, well past sunset.  [[MC]] tried to remember how often the bus came at the nearest stop, and verified mentally what the route was to take home. He remembered it was just a 15 minute ride back to the main station, and then another 20 for the route that passed right in front of uncle [[Rod]]s house.

##### The Wackness

[[MC]] had an uneventful quick walk to the stop nearest the shop, and according to the schedule, the next bus should get there within the next 5 minutes or so. He took advantage of the time to do a mental recap of what homework he had to do between now and when it would be checked tomorrow, and in which particular class. A part of him wishes it wasn't so easy to get by by doing everything last minute, but so far all 10 grades of school had been like that. 

Some people seemed to imply that in junior and senior year that changes, or at least that there's a significant work increase. But, [[MC]] could only take that with a grain of salt, as things didn't seem as easy for others as they did for him most of the time.

Alright so...same as today he had chemistry and math for sure, and...what was the assignment for history..? Was it just some reading he could catch up on later, since he probably already knew the gist of the subject from being exposed to it somewhere else? It was then that he felt it. He'd only heard of this before, and never in real life, but only in movies and books, but this definitely had to be it. He felt that he was being watched.  He looked down both ways of the semi-lit, mid-urbanish street.  Nothing but parked cars and the dim iridescence of the streetlights at present. He could see headlights of a car maybe half a mile down the road (he and the bus stop were on some sort of hill, for what could pass as a hill in southeastern Texas.) That definitely wasn't it.  

Everyone else leaving the comic shop either headed for their nearby cars or in the opposite direction.  He felt it again, the weird eerie feeling, and this time it was accompanied by something else uncanny.  Something that seemed to...lightly pull on...multiple of his senses at once.  It was like he could...hear something inaudible, or smell something near imperceptible, but there. He'd read about synasthesia, but this was not that. It was as if both senses were being bombarded by something they could detect but not pinpoint or interpret using any of the typical tools his brain had.  There was definitely....yeah. It had a darkness to it. There was no other word that made sense. It felt ominous, like the moment before heartbeat-skipping dread, but the beat would never land. It would just kind of hover there, like a bad dubstep remix. #edit #too-corny?

He started to look around, more frantically. The buildings nearby weren't exactly imposing, but a couple were several stories high, a couple apartment buildings. Was it someone on the roof, or doing something to him out the window? He'd read about some crazy supersonic weapons the CIA tests in foreign countries on 4chan.  But nah, that supposedly made you deaf and quickly knocked you unconscious.  Couldn't be that, not to mention that it probably didn't exist. This was real, he was feeling it right now. Was it real? When was the last time he ate? His vision started to blur as well. It felt like he was gonna pass out. The feeling was definitely getting stronger.  

He glanced down a not-so-close alleyway across the street. He'd been looking at eye level and above, but something told him to try looking closer to the ground, and then he saw it. ...A cat? A black cat? He walked a few steps down the street, not necessarily closer to it, but it did give him a better vantage point. One of the various light sources bounced off the retinas of the feline to give that familiar reflection effect. Is this what was causing this feeling? The cat wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary.....but he could definitely *feel* something was off. It was as if-

He then heard the loudest noise he had ever heard in his life from behind him somewhere. It was the bus hydraulics, making that annoying sound they do just before the lower slightly and open their doors. Those must have been the headlights he saw in the distance. But between then and now he had no idea that it was coming. It was as if time had stopped there, momentarily.  The driver gave him a look. He had just been standing there, not getting on. He quickly took out his card, hopped on, slid it across the reader to hear the vaguley familiar ding, and went to sit down.  What the hell was that? Was that real?  

As the bus drove away, the feeling began to dissipate, quickly becoming nothing, as if it never existed. [[MC]] couldn't explain it, but he knew that there must be some unsexy explanation for what it could have been. No need to make his mind go crazy or move into the conspiratorial like it had wanted to earlier. That wasn't his style. It didn't make sense for the way he interpreted the world, and that seemed to work just fine for him until a minute ago. Don't break the streak, man, he told himself.

The bus wound around following the main parkway that crossed the outskirts of town perpendicularly, he began to feel like himself again. He knew that once he got home, he'd be able to distract himself playing or watching something, and forget all of this ever happened. In fact, now it seemed like his brain was telling him he *needed* to forget this, which was also weird and not typically how his brain communicated with him.  He also just noticed he had been subconsciously rubbing the pendant with two fingers, while it was safely in his pocket. What was that about? Deranged behavior. Whatever. It had been a weird day.

It was just then that he realized tomorrow, Friday, was a holiday.  He'd have the day off of school, and [[Rod]] would probably be off of work. Nice! It had been a while. Maybe they could do something together. He made a note to bring it up before going up to his room.  It also meant he didn't have to do homework until Monday morning at the earliest. Double nice! As the bus pulled into the main station, and [[MC]] idly went on autopilot to grab the transfer line home (he remembered the route as soon as he got to the station, like riding a bike), he just started thinking about what he was going to do tonight and with the rest of his weekend. 

He'd been trying to find time to set aside to watch the *Vengeance* trilogy for a second time. It had been a while.  Man, *Oldboy* was so good. Maybe he would watch that one first and then see whats up. He pondered this and other options up until he was almost home, got off the bus, and made the short walk up to uncle [[Rod]]s house without any further incident.

##### Incursion

It had been close. #edit (need synonym) Practically equidistant at every scale [[x8]] knew in it's Lexicon. This was a missed opportunity. There would be others, but this should be marked as an error. A failure. It's tendrils had tasted it. Even in this minuscule and primitive dark #edit #word-for-black mammalian form, the Pull had been deep. #edit. 

The Objective had been there, immediate and seemingly omnipresent, across the pathetic division between dwelling areas that the humans used for their main form of transportation. Inefficiently wasting hydrocarbons by igniting them, with not even the wherewithal to realize the immense destruction it caused without Recapture. And then, it was gone. Moving away on one of their pathetic vehicles. A failure. 

It had traveled halfway across this Septudrant, only to leave with the goal unmet at first real encounter. The Principle did not give [[x8]] these gifts for it to squander them in this manner. It made a note that this was to be a Pennance memory. To be revisited as punishment and motivation to avoid further mistakes in the future. If The Collective were present in this moment, he would have been eviscerated or dishonorably absorbed on the spot.  Unacceptable. Pull.

No matter. It was a triviality in the zoomed out #edit (synonym or better wording for zoomed out) view. It would execute it's work and obtain The Objective on the next encounter, and that was that. The Principle had not seen it fit to make dwelling on failure paramount, merely very important. Enough to make certain it would not happen again.

[[x8]] began to formulate a plan. It surmised that the next Pulls would be inconsistent, as the Objective was moving away. It would be able to feel generally when that distance stopped increasing and became relatively static. It's Lexicon told it that humans rarely travelled more than ten to 15 miles, one of their main units of measurement, from their dwellings where they rested approximately one third of their planet's rotational time.

It would wait until that stasis appeared and begin to study it's target, in order to avoid further complications of the magnitude that had just occurred, or greater.  There would not be greater. It would not allow it. It had been in thousands of retrieval operations, the vast majority more difficult than this. The unknown unknowns in its Lexicon for this mission were few. Inconsequential. It would move forward, achieved, succeed, and Return.

It took in it's surroundings as this creature. A cat, they called it in their languages. Typical quadrupedal structure, but this form had some impressive gifts bestowed upon it from The Principle.  The optical sense was calibrated for precision found in predators, and had the ability to do this even in near complete darkness. [[x8]] could also sense that it's natural reflexes and agility were several sigma outside the norm for this planet. Impressive, even if nothing compared to the reaction time of [[x8]] itself. It took countless eons to evolve to that, so what this cat already had, was impressive.  Where it really mattered when it came to being able to handle what [[x8]] had done to it, however, was another matter.

It delved it's tendrils back into the cerebral cortex of the animal, subdued as it was under Symbiosis. Some organics had an uncanny ability to resist Symbiosis, even when completely overtaken by the process. [[x8]] was never in any danger of being overrun, of course, but it did take significant resources to keep the cortex at bay at times.  This cat, as it were, scored slightly above average from [[x8]]s past experience, and closer to average when added to everything in the Lexicon.

It knew, through its Lexicon, that at times in his species' history there were various Individuals who chose to remain in their hosts for prolonged periods of time, increasing the Symbiotic relationship over time. The Principle had deemed it valuable to have this particular ability, over time, create connections which after a certain point, became irreversible. For all intents and purposes, the host and Individual would become one, over time.  The time needed varied, proportional to the complexity of the Host's corpus, but was always over several Standard Cycles, (not so different in standard timeunits #edit (use time thing) from human years, it realized).

It had never found such a host, like some of it's peers.

The longer they remained with their host, the more likely Unity was to occur. Still a relatively rare phenomenon within it's species history, but enough to know it was not caused by any galactic anomaly or other dilation effects that have also been observed #edit. [[x8]] was not interested in Unity. It despised and looked down upon every species it had ever encountered. Even the impressive ones did nothing with their gifts, compared to the glorious and storied history of it's own. It sought it's own valor for itself, it lived for the challenge and yes, the slight danger, of the most perilous and difficult missions. It would conquer and destroy everything in it's path in order to achieve it's goal. Pull.

Still moving away. It could focus on gathering resources and preparing for the next attempt at retrieving the Objective. [[x8]] analyzed it's host's weapons. It had several units of organic matter that ended in a sharp point, and was retractable at will on all of its limbs. Not useless, but due to this animals' relative size, would not be all that formidable compared to [[x8]]s natural gifts and predilections for limbs ending in cutting and rending tools. It would also need to Rest again soon, which most likely meant either discarding or absorbing this host for Resources. As it weighed it's options, something happened further into the area between two dwellings it currently occupied.  The light of this planet's star reflecting off of it's moon was more than enough for this host to be able to discern what was to come.

"Come on, I know a place where we can lay low." said a human. One of two that were headed towards [[x8]]. Adult males. Their chosen garb was clearly made to make them more difficult to see to other humans, a primitive form of stealth or concealment, it surmised. However, it did nothing for that when it came to the host's visual sense.  They also seemed to be moving in a way as to attempt to dampen their sound, also not much of a match for the cat's hearing ability. It understood that this too was more than human level.  Cat's were likely not worthy of hiding from for humans, at this present intersection of their evolutional Paths. 

It's likely that in their past that had not been the case, and also likely that it would not be the case again in their future, that is, if after reaching it's Objective [[x8]] left enough of either of their species to be able to have such a future interaction. Briefly it entertained the thought of the energy it would need to expend to make eliminate that possibility of intersection from the perspective of either species line.  As they ran past, it finished several iterations of the calculation, adding entertaining permutations for good measure. But, that was all it had time for. Seeing one of the humans as it ran past, made it clear it was time to do some further, more concrete experimentation.  

Following the humans in this host form was trivial, it did not attract attention whatsoever. They traveled in a haphazard way, with behavior alien to [[x8]] in various ways, until arriving at a series of steps that led under the main surface of the immediate area. Loud sounds could be heard through the nearby windows. [[x8]] surmised it possible it was music. "Down here, my cousin owns the bar, we used to hide out here in the cellar all the time as kids, I think the key is here somewhere..."

One of the humans began to touch along the wall near the window the music was coming out of. One of the rectangular dwelling shapes/forms #edit (find good way to say brick) gave way under their hand.  It reached in with that hand's fingers and seemed to pull something out. A thing elongated piece of material, with intricate patterns cut out of one side of it. It also shone in the moonlight. "Aha! Still here."  The human then rejoined it's partner and went down the stairs, briefly out of sight of [[x8]] and cat.  By the time it got to the foot of the stairs, the door several dozen feet down into an underground dwelling of sorts, was slowly closing, with the humans already inside.

It began to release it's tendrils from the cat. As it did so, what looked like an ordinary cat to an outside observer began to look very strange. It would appear as if a translucent semi-solid substance was appearing to come out of it's back from no known orifice, and grow quickly to a size larger than the cat itself, perhaps the consistency and appearance of several layers of dark house paint, given form and the ability to congeal itself into a more cohesive shape than a flat surface.

The shape grew larger and larger and began to separate itself from the cat further. It seeped down in uncanny waves, not quite liquid but not quite solid, down it's legs as well as sliding from it's back to its sidequarters,  "spilling" onto the floor. #edit (this whole paragraph sucks kinda, find better description ability dude)

As it separated, the host cat was still not in control of it's own actions. [[x8]] was still making it stand completely rigid and still, for convenience. It always had the option to leave it's host relatively unharmed. If the time of Symbiosis was relatively short, prior to any Unity beginning, The Principle bestowed the gift of being able to leave the host in this way.  This was one of the options, but it was not one that [[x8]] ever remembered taking advantage of.  Once it was completely Separate, and released it's hold, the cat did not have much time to react to what happened to it next.  [[x8]] made it's own version of the cat's claws, taking it's design and making what it considered some improvements. They were approximately ten times longer, two orders of magnitude sharper, and instead of just the paltry 5 claws on each hand, [[x8]] saw fit to make 5 limbs, each with 13 of these re-imagined rending tools.

It played a game with itself to see within what delta of time it could insert all sixty of the sharpened points into the cat's body from beginning to end. By it's calculation, it had achieved it in a fraction of a human standard time unit. The second, they called it. He wondered if the cat, like many of his victims any time he exited Symbiosis, had had time to even react to it's fate before the combined collateral damage of all of it's necessary parts were turned to #edit so much detritus, to be discarded, not even worthy of absorption into it's Whole.

There was another Pull, which reminded [[x8]] of what it was to do next. It slowly slid down the stairs, remaining in one of its more primordial Shapes, seeming at times glistening  ebony in the light of this moon and at times fully opaque, dark as the complete absence of photons.  Not quite solid, and not quite liquid, it lithely approached the door.  There would be little need for subtlety here, nevertheless, it decided to remove the primitive deterrent on the door silently.  All it took was for it to raise itself in it's current Shape, and find the orifice where presumably the human had inserted the key.  As it reached out with a thin part of itself, that part slowly formed into a rough copy of the pattern it had glimpsed when the human had removed the key from the alcove.  Such a pattern was nowhere near the limits of its dexterity to form, and recreating it was a triviality.

It slid into the orifice and was able to feel what minor adjustments it needed to make in order to activate the mechanism.  It already achieved four-nines of precision on it's first attempt, and it realized that any further adjustments, although precise, were quite unnecessary for this rudimentary technology. Still, [[x8]] took a form of pride in it's work, and felt a sort of delight as it easily opened the door...

The two humans were not very far in, though their backs were turned from it, focused on several items it could not quite make out due to the lack of proper Senses needed to interpret this level of luminescence while in this Shape, especially with it's Tendrills still recalled.  It also sensed a new source for what it had previously identified as music, this time emanating much closer to the two targets.  Both that sensory source and the glistening and distinctly patterned items were on a raised platform that [[x8]] had already seen several times and surmised it was a platform that humans used to bring things to a more comfortable height appropriate for their typical bipedial stance.  They also used them in conjunction with another technology that supported their hindquarters while they flexed their bottom limbs at a ninety-degree angle.  Tables and chairs, were the names for these items in it's Lexicon, and the act of limb-bending was known as sitting.  [[x8]] found such actions moderately revolting, these being perverting that which was bestowed upon them by The Principle. If they only knew the potential misery of most of the galaxy in that department #edit (gotta be a better word, too anthro).

"Shit was so easy. We should hit them at least once a month." said one.

"Don't be a fuckin' retard. That's basically just asking to get caught. Don't ever hit the same place twice." said the other.

"Yeah but, look at this shit. They just had the gold and diamonds sittin' there, under the glass. I barely had to tap the glass and it shattered like nothin'.  Shit, I pistol whipped that mothafucka harder than I hit that glass, and you saw what it did."

"That was a stupid thing to do and if it happens again, I'm out. We were out. Done. Easy hit. Why did you even do that, bruh?"

The other human made a gesture by raising and lowering it's upper haunches and showed it's teeth slightly. 

[[x8]] did not understand that gesture, and it's Lexicon was not useful in deciphering it. It could surmise that they were reviewing a recent mission they had just undertaken. It had been successful, but the older, more interesting human was chastising the younger one on an unnecessarily risk or maneuver it had taken.  The details were not important, but by this exchange [[x8]] was able to tell which one made more sense to take as it's host.  The older one was taller, more muscular, and clearly more knowledgeable than the other one. The younger human seemed brash and unprincipled, aloof in victory and seemingly ignoring the wisdom imparted by the elder.  In addition to this, [[x8]] could tell it had considerably less musculature, and it's general brainwave activity, even with the basic sensors available to [[x8]] in it's current Shape, showed diminished capacity in comparison.

[[x8]] remained in their diminutive, malleable  #edit (better word) Shape.  Silently, they went around the side of the room. There were various containers with what appeared to be various hydrocarbons, combined with some base sugars and hydroxides.  Could they be fuel? There were many small, individual containers. It seems like they had been primitively distilled for further purity, before being entangled once again with various organic matter specific to this planet.  [[x8]] lithely formed itself up and around one of the higher containers, to get a better vantage point of the humans and their conversation.

Pull. The last one indicated that the Objective was relatively static, but with this one it was on the move again, in a slightly different direction. [[x8]] did not understand the series of events, but surmised that the human must reach their destination dwelling soon, as it was very close to the local time the vast majority of them Rested. 

[[x8]] refocused on the humans in the room, and the contents they were observing. A closer inspection did not assist his sense in better understanding what the items on the raised platform were.  No matter, there was a good way of discerning this information. It was time to Attach to a human.  On most missions [[x8]] did not like to jump into Attaching onto one of the dominant life forms immediately.  It preferred to wait, observe, and understand in its more primordial forms first.  However, that time was passed. It was now the opportune moment.

It silently slid down the stacked containers of distillate, simultaneously Forming two novel limbs out of its Shape.  This time, it opted for a semicircular shape, rounded side up. It Formed the curved side, the one facing outward, just as sharp as it's previous weapons of choice.  Any organic matter that made contact with any part of this, would no longer be intact shortly thereafter.  As it reached the floor, it raised itself up.  The Principle had gifted it with the ability to Form much larger than it's concentrated Shape appeared able to do. It silently went up and up, until achieving a form approximately as large as the larger human.

The two victims were still unaware #edit (perhaps better word here). The older had began disassembling what appeared to be a primitive type of ballistic weapon, while the younger had occupied itself with opening one of the containers along a different wall, however appearing very similar to the ones [[x8]] had just been on top of.  It opened the top, and connected the container to it's main orifice at the head of it's body.  [[x8]] understood this was the primary orifice for nourishment, connected to a digestive system typical of most mammals on this planet.  

The dog and fox had had similar.  [[x8]] now understood that these containers were not fuel, but something to be ingested.  [[x8]] now had additional queries, as it seemed that this chemical formula was largely indigestible by the human system. It would create various debilitating effects. Were these being so primitive that they did not realize this? [[x8]] surmised this must not be the case. Oftentimes things were not as simple and straightforward as they appeared, especially when it came to The Principle, and how it chose to Order the stochastic, otherwise uncaring universe.

As it appeared from the dimly lit area closer to the two humans, it made no effort to conceal itself or use subterfuge of any kind. This was to be another moment just for it. The unsuitable one would be used for pleasure.  The older human noticed first, and, almost reflexively, with impressive quickness armed the ballistic weapon and pointed it at [[x8]].  The younger human, as had now become a pattern, remained relatively unaware until it's eyes went from the alarmed older human, to finally gaze upon [[x8]].

[[x8]] saw the familiar realization dawn on it's face. More cognizant than the previous creatures it had encountered directly, but barely.  Fear. Pure, unbridled, unadulterated fear. [[x8]]s sensemaking tendrils drank deeply from the plane which transmuted this feeling into higher dimensions. As far as it could tell, humans were unaware of this phenomenon. Unsurprising. Even advanced civilizations did not have ubiquitous understanding of this plane, and how to manipulate and harness the resources within.  The Principle had deemed [[x8]]s species worthy of being able to directly interact with it.  The energy transfer of such an emotion was not spectacular, however, it made [[x8]]s Memories all the more vivid for which to recall later, if tied to the imbibing of this plane.

As this was happening, the younger also reflexively began to scream from it's main orifice. It rose too quickly from where it was bent along it's lower limbs (in the chair), and almost immediately fell over backward, terrified.  The older, still clearly not fully understanding, however seemingly having had some experience being in peril, reflexively began manipulating the mechanism which fired the ballistic weapon, still pointed at [[x8]].  The projectiles came out loud and relatively fast, but nothing such as approximating the relativistic Limits tested by many other weapons [[x8]] was familiar with. 

They traveled, with some precision, directly into what would be the general center of it's current Shape. [[x8]] had been waiting some time, and had already prepared the area of it's Shape facing the humans for absorption, this being one of the likely predictable outcomes when it had done it's automated risk calculations using it's Subprocesses.  The projectiles, round oblates driven by both heat and kinetic energy, struck with considerable forces, so far the highest delta measured by [[x8]] per unit of area at this Scale.  By some cosmic coincidence, the Pull happened near simultaneously as one of the projectiles made contact. If [[x8]] had not been prepared, it is possible this could have caused some temporary Damage, given the brief hostile takeover of it's mental process during the Pull itself.  No matter. It had not happened. It had been ready. It would not make any more mistakes.

As the last of the 13 projectiles were harmlessly absorbed into it's Shape, it began to move slowly towards the younger. Bipedally, as to imitate the humans; practice for what was to come.  The younger had initially began backing away pathetically, clearly unaccustomed to moving backwards with all four limbs on the ground.  However, after what had only been a few seconds, the paralysis began to set in. The Principle was merciful, at times. Benevolent, even.  A part of [[x8]] wanted to see what  these humans were like when attempting to escape, but that would have to wait until another time. It slowly covered the remaining distance to the younger, it's keen, improvised appendages nearing their intended target.

As [[x8]] raised one of them up to slice open the younger, (deciding on where to strike as it did so), it noticed that the older, having been unsuccessful with the ballistic weapon was now gripping one of the aforementioned chairs.  It rushed at [[x8]] and swung the chair at them with all of their strength.  A noteworthy improvisation, this human would make a finer Host than [[x8]] had previously surmised.  As it thought this, it rotated it's other axe-limb to point sharp side towards the oncoming chair. As it struck, the repurposed deciduous fibers split along the edge of of the axe tip, with uncannily little resistance.  The force with which it had been slammed into the alien creature seemed to dissipate unnaturally as the pieces of the now destroyed chair clinked harmlessly around [[x8]] onto the ground.

As the older human feebly tried to interpret it's impossible surroundings, [[x8]] returned to it's previous objective.  It had decided where it wanted to strike. As the axe-limb came down on the youngers closest limb, it separated from the rest of his body as if it no longer belonged to it. #edit (clumsy, reword).  And indeed, it did not. The axe-limb had cut through skin, muscle, bone, and everything else just as if it had not been there at all.  Immediately, blood began to spurt out from the open wound.  The Lexicon had said that there were creatures on this planet that had cauterizing and regenerative abilities, capable of dealing with limb removal, but The Principle seemingly did not grant anything of the sort to humans.  

A brief silence of the screaming and pause of the fear emanation ensued, quickly followed by a release of a combination of fear and anguish, in tandem with even louder screaming and now the younger's body began writhing, seemingly uncontrollably, while the human's senses took in what was happening as best it could.  [[x8]] had seen enough. It had thought this would be suitable for It's Memories, however the various distractions from the older, combined with the lack of resistance, made it unsuitable.  The younger did not seem to notice as the other axe-limb quickly separated their head from the rest of their body, at the neck.

It was over as quickly as it began. The screaming stopped as the connections to vital components were severed.  Blood pooled around [[x8]]s lower limbs, holding them upright. It had a thick, sticky consistency.  It's sensemaking organs would evaluate it as mostly acrid, with hints of sweetness as well.  The way The Principle decided which senses created which feelings was sacred. [[x8]] cherished this moment as best it could, before the next Pull brought it's Objective back into focus, as well as the older human.

By now, they realized that whatever [[x8]] was, their attempts at hurting it were futile.  It began to look at the escape routes available.  One was up towards the music and likely other humans ([[x8]] could vaguely sense them behind and above them, perhaps a fifteen other humans, most in various stages of melancholy and relaxation. [[x8]] surmised that these large stores of debilitating liquid were because the location above dispensed them at a rapid rate, thus the need for ample stores quickly available.  He still did not quite understand the why, but soon, It imagined it would, without ambiguity.

--

[[Jeff]] stared at what had just happened, in shock and disbelief. Not much could shake him, but this had.  There were only two ways in or out of this storeroom.  One was being blocked by the...thing.  The other was the way they had come in.  He quickly turned and began to sprint towards that direction.  He had no idea what this thing was, but it was time to get away from it as quickly as possible. This thing was pure evil, and it had just killed Ty.  He had emptied the clip and nothing. He had swung the chair at it and it ripped it in two like it was a paper bag.  The marines had prepared him for just about anything, but clearly not *everything*. It was time to disengage.

As he turned he could...*feel* the thing looking at him. It was impossible to describe. But it didn't matter. He had to get out of there.  He had just gotten a foot on the first step when he felt something grab the back of his head.  Then his left arm, which had been swung back in the typical way one does when running at full clip, then another grip on his right hip.  He struggled to break free, but it was no use. He was a strong guy, but what gripped him might as well have been hands made of the HSLA steel he used to weld onto aircraft in Kandahar. Even though part of him kind of knew it would be no use, he instinctively used his free arm and reached behind him to grab what had grabbed him.

It felt...sticky?  He was completely immobile at this point, as two more arms...or legs...whatever.... had gripped him in additional places, perfectly spaced so that he couldn't move any appendages.  He knew it was the blacker-than-black skin of whatever the hell that thing was, that he had touched.  And now, he couldn't pull away. His hand was stuck, as stuck as all the other parts of his body that had contact with it.  And then slowly, all the limbs at once began pulling him back, at the same speed and distance so as to keep him in exactly the position he was in, mid stride, when he was caught.   It was precise enough to keep him upright as it did so.  No human or machine that he knew could do this.

Suddenly he could feel....something. It was not really describable. Like an itch inside of his brain that was impossible to scratch.  As the creature pulled him in, he made his peace with the world. He wasn't a bad guy, but he did do things he wasn't proud of, especially since the divorce and the discharge. He thought of his daughter. His whole life didn't flash, like they say in the movies, it was just the last memory he had of her, watchign her on the playground, before her mother took her away for good.  The itching sensation became intense, more intense than any pain he'd ever felt.  He felt other parts of his body being touched by that...thing. It was...absorbing him. Engulfing him in the sticky black shit.  As the world darkened around him, he thought of swing sets, mulch, and colorful ladders...

[[x8]] drank deep.  It's first attempt at Attaching to a human Host had not gone well.  That first night, after disposing of the dog, it had gone up the stairs of the human dwelling and found the old, feeble human. Clearly at the end of it's natural life in this plane. It had looked at [[x8]], and as it stepped back in terror, had slipped and fallen, hitting it's substantive cranium on the upper floor. It was made of the same dead and processed deciduous matter as the chair.  Such feeble pathetic creatures.  The Principle had not even (yet) given them regeneration of the sensitive areas around it's processing core.  

[[x8]] attempted to Attach to the human after it had fallen, but it was too late.  This human was too feeble and too frail, and the fall had put it very near death.  Blood was slowly pooling out of the opening made when their head had hit the floor. It had screamed in anger at having It's plan thwarted.  As It went to a dark corner of the dwelling and prepared to Rest, it decided it would choose a more suitable target for It's second attempt at Attachment.

This was that moment, and it had been worth it. [[x8]] began to absorb all of the knowledge of this human, all of it's memories, all of its emotions and history.  It learned many terms of this planet. Money, pawn shops, guns, buses, even primitive military strategy that this Host had learned and implemented during various missions.  Briefly, [[x8]] felt what can only be understood as a primitive form of kinship. An understanding of the Host, as it had in life had similar goals and Objectives as [[x8]].  Pull.  This took [[x8]] out of this feeling, and It was thankful.  Kinship was known as an early sign that this Host was a candidate for Unity, but [[x8]] had no interest in that. He considered those who chose that path as lesser.  Those who would rather be complacent than conquer. Who would settle rather than do everything out of respect for  The Principle, and glory of The Whole.

As it refined and interrogated the Host mind, taking only the most useful and unambiguous parts of it's new knowledge, it stored them away for processing during the time it next Rested.  Then, it would upload all that new information to the Lexicon, ensuring it was kept and shared with the entire Whole.  Before that time, the knowledge would remain only within [[x8]], and would be at risk of loss until uploaded. This rule was one of the ones most strictly adhered to during missions. Any first contact with a new Prime Host must have it's knowledge extracted and processed at the next available time of Rest. It is how The Whole came to be so dominant in this arm of the galaxy. [[x8]] always followed this rule, as did all the other Seekers.

Pull. It now had a much better understanding of where and what had happened to it's Objective.  The adolescent male had taken a bus, likely back to the central station, as this was most likely the first pause in location data during Pulls earlier, and then transferred to another bus to reach it's final destination for the evening, likely it's home or at least where it would sleep for the night.  [[x8]] decided it would make best attempts at thinking in this species terms.  As primitive and backward as it was, it was highly recommended for Seekers to do this, as it often aided in completing missions in a way that would not be immediately obvious.  The Lexicon information, although an incredible resource, was not perfect.

It now knew many things that would aid it. The bar above was called the Southside Tap House. The town where it currently resided was called League City, Texas.  The nearest escape upon completing its mission was to be found at a nearby region called Houston Space Center.  These being still relied on hydrocarbon propulsion in order to escape their planet's gravity, although they seemed to be close to discovering various fusion techniques which would make them obsolete.  A pity. [[x8]] would have to make do with the more rudimentary option.  No matter. It would not be the first time. 

The initial knowledge transfer was complete. [[x8]] also became in tune with all the mechanisms that controlled a human body, from the inside.  It used that knowledge to rise from the ground. [[Jeff]], this being had been called.  [[x8]] would use this body to reach it's Objective. This form was much more suitable than the cat for maneuvering around the human world. They had created various systems to facilitate themselves, at the expense of essentially all other lesser beings on the planet. A typical trajectory for most dominant species, until they reach a certain understanding.  The Whole was once such a species.  Long ago.

It would conceal itself in the pockets of clothing that [[Jeff]] wore, so as to not attract attention. While inhabitation a Host, [[x8]] could remain attached in many many different configurations, depending on the situation. But the task at hand called for camouflage.  Pull.  It seems the adolescents with the Objective had arrived at their home. This was the third Pull where the location information remained relatively stable.

It would go up to this Southside Tap House, and speak to other humans. Interact with them. Learn more for the Lexicon.  And then return to what it now knew to be [[Jeff]]s home, to Rest once more.  These activities had taken considerable Resources, so it was likely that the Rest duration would last from later this Earth night until well into the next Earth afternoon, they called it.

Then, it would hunt.
