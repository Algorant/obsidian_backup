#### Description:: I will attempt to move the entire [[The Joe Rogan Experience|JRE]] library over to something self hosted, where I can remove the ads and do all kinds of other things. Currently the only way to listen to the show is basically through #spotify which, although I am not entirely against, still sucks in many ways.
#### Links::
#### Repo::
#### Todo:: Get this one off the ground. Will need some #php work seems like, but with #chatgpt you can get through it.
#### Tags:: #jre #libre-not-gratis #foss #spotify
