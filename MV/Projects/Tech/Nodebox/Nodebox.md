#### Description:: The plan would be to create an #uncle-jim setup where #the-boys as well as friends and family can use a trusted #bitcoin node to connect to and do their business, and know I'll never fuck them over.  Also useful for learning how to do this for myself, as well as being able to show others in the future.

		- Very polished and very nice, still a little bit too bitcoin focused, which is not bad, but not my current use case I don't think.
		- This is at odds almost exactly with what I said before or did in my head, which is that I wanted an easy solution for mostly bitcoin stuff and not much else
		- Its definitely what I would recommend to the right person, but not what I want for the [[Nodebox]]
