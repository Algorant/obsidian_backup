This is a nickname for the system popularized by [[David Allen]] around #task-management  and #organization .  

### According to #chatgpt , here is a summary of the 5 basic tenets in it:

#### **Capture** 
- Gather all the tasks, ideas, and projects you need to handle - both immediate and future ones. Write them down or record them somewhere, to ensure nothing is lost or forgotten.

#### **Clarify** 
- Process what you've captured. Decide if an item is actionable or not. If it is, decide on the next action. If it's a big project, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks.

#### **Organize**
- Put your clarified items where they belong. For example, tasks go onto to-do lists, appointments go on your calendar, reference materials go into a filing system, etc. You can categorize tasks by context (where you can do them), time needed, or energy level required.

#### **Reflect** 
- Review your system regularly. Daily, look at your calendar and task lists to decide what to do next. Weekly, review your whole system, to update and clean out your lists, and ensure everything is current and aligned with your goals.

#### **Engage**
- Do the tasks. With a clear mind and a system you trust, you can focus more effectively on the task at hand.

Although I am probably not going to become a full #gtd disciple, I can definitely get tons of #wisdom from it.
