The creator company of various AI models such as #dall-e #chatgpt and #gpt4 

They are basically anything but open, as a lot of the work they do is closed source. Even then, they are ok I think.

They are clearly way ahead of everyone else as far as AI tools, and #chatgpt is basically the most successful app of all time (by how long it took to get to x users, say 100,000,000).

Their CEO is [[Sam Altman]], who is a pretty interesting person.  Head of #y-combinator for a long time, as well as being known as a meme for having #double-popped-collars for a very long time, its fascinating that he is the person he is now.

I currently subscribe to #chatgpt and use their #api for various things such as [[Obsidian]], [[neovim]], and with the [[GPT Slackbot]] I made for #the-boys and I.
