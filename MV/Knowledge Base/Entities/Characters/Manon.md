### To Practice
- Drive Counters during pressure
	- f+drive impact in blockstring?
- confirming off c.lp to no meter stuff
- 
- Juggle state combos
- Wake up reversals bait punish (level 3?)
- Blanka jump grab
	- Seems like just neutral jump is punish, maybe try ex moves
- EX overhead kicks -> s.mp-> supers as drive rush combo ender
- On DI crumple:
	- Can do overhead target combo -> throw-grab
	- In corner: b.HP->spin kick combos
- On Wakeup DP/Supers:
	- Parry then do your thing instead of blocking
- jump in + overhead target combo 
- overhead target combo after crumple
- corner carry max punish (b.hp + ex kick)
- anti fireball trick (ex roll + kick)

### General Tips

- Always back tech
- Take the grab, especially midscreen
- Use meter, you build between 5-7 per game, just go ham.
- Take your time when they are burned out

#### Misc

#### Things to practice
- Confirms after floating state (like air punish counter)
- 

#### iDom Tricks

- Use drive rush a lot with s.LK 
- After rough corner setup (where you are still far away), use twirly kick to make floating state, then free combo. You are really far away so still kinda safe.
- Drive rush into raw Drive Impact in corner pressure situation.
- s.mp into drive rush command grab from sweep range
- Challenge raw drive rushes with s.mp
- For people jumping back in the corner:
	- qcf+kk, level 2

[[Louffy]] tricks

- use first hit of target combos, then go straight into command grab (overhead one and s.hp one)
