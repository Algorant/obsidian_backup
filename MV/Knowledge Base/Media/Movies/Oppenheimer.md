## Notes
- In theory this should be like catnip
- RDJ looks good old?
- Me 1 hour in: OMG this is a fucking ww2 movie in disguise
- Surprise Matt Damon. Every time. Listen nolan its not a surprise after the 4th time
- Fargo husband guy and The Boys guy Jack Quaid!
- Weapon of Mass Destruction, anarchonism?
	- ChatGPT says it was Harry S Truman
- The gadget, don't say bomb. Nice touch
- The women suck in this. Unlikable and too crazy
- Benny Safdie of [[Uncut Gems]] is Teller, guy with the eyeliner
- JFK and Einstein things felt a little forced 
- three parts, Nolan wanted to intersperse the last part but wasn't enough time 
- it won't be for you, it will be for them 
- technically also an adaptation!
- end shots were good, world on fire
- should have ended on smash mouth
