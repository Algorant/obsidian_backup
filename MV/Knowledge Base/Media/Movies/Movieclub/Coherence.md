#### Notes
- themes
	- "Katherine merris has your life" to the dancer
	- metaphor of cutting the picture 
- guilty pleasure because not sure it's a good movie, but I love the premise and execution is decent 
- creepy things 
	- two guys amir and science guy are already other group 
	- Xander sends the blackmail letter
	- the book 
	- the container with pictures
	- the notes 
	- broken window?
		- he's the other Jason! When checking cars
- Things I like
	- Dinner party, pretty natural convo
- Interesting Parts
	- The man in the house is not my husband.
	- Xander on the show Roswell 
	- little dated (big phones, skype)
	- everyone kinda understood Schrodinger's cat pretty quickly 
- Reveals
	- the wtf moments really work for me
	- amir and hugh with the red glow sticks
	- when you learn jason at the car isn't her jason
	- when you learn the numbers are all different
- Questions
	- Is this movie more about decoherence or is it about relationships or is it about all the different ways life can turn out
	- what would you do?
	- the ending: to me kind of unsatisfying ending but pretty good
- For presentation:
	- I will show how to make a website using a modern framework that makes it easy
