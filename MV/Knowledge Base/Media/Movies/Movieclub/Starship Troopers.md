#### Notes
- just jumps in there 
- corny news broadcast over the top violence 
- future football, progressive with diz
- all the teachers all fucked up, some Spartan stuff about citizenry 
- would you like to know more 
- need a baby license 
- showed a dead dog! Bugs gotta die
- news propaganda 
- teacher is Heinlein analogue 
- little wince when he picks up his bag before walk of shame
