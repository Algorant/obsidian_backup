## #Movieclub notes 
- Notable points:
	- hard open 
	- great sound design 
	- they get the visceralness of it so well. Everything is so mechanical it almost doesn't make sense in our digital world 
	- WW2 dogfighting is insanity compared to modern day 
	- non narrative part
		- oh shittt there's a time component because ofc 
		- crazy timeline when they get on the moonshine 
- moments
	- German planes coming in, horrifying 
	- torpedooooo omg. Pitch black underwater instantly 
	- target practice then shot in the face, rough 
- [[Lisa]] made a point
	- [[Tom Hardy]] with a mask on once again 
	- opposite of [[Harry Styles]], has no lines in movie vs Tom Hardy, lots of lines with his frog voice but no face
- Questions:
	- would you guys lock [[Cillian Murphy]] in? 
	- that old bloke wouldn't even look us in the eye 
	- flies in the shot just like good bad and ugly when dude says he's blind
		- what did this mean? 
	- why were the navy standing there when they took the moonshine off dock?
