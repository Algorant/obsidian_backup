- Interesting opening
- More modern than I thought it would be
- Lady's a prankster, her dad owns the paper? she plays practical jokes?
- Teacher scene
- How is it the guy when she lands the boat?
- No they're not fussy chickens
- He mostly meets hoods
- Oh shit, she jumped into a fountain in Rome!?
- Kids eating chicken lol
- Ornithologist is similar to that lawyer at end of psycho. But less monologue and more factoid lady actually interacting with characters
- cars blowing up montage lol
	- still shot, then explosion, then another still haha
- People start freaking out in panic situations
- I love that these movies just end, no credits. The vibe is different.
