#### Movie Notes:

- Act II >>>> Act I
- I have a hard time with this movie, especially the first time
	- In the heyday of criminal minds and CSI and law and order
	- This plot, like just the plot elements of this, would be like a below average episode for any of those shows
- Bates motel
- Music is iconic
- The suspense still works
- Just too slow for modern audience (aka me)
- If this was the plot of a criminal minds episode it would be average.
- Mental voices technique? Her imagination?
- Taxidermy
- Traps line and convo
- Is she supposed to be super hot?
- Peephole. Nice
- Whole cleanup scene. Way too long by modern standards
- Candy corn. Definitely psycho
- Much more interesting after murder
- Arbogast and Bates convo suspenseful
- Little bit too expositional at the end, but it's ok
- Nice ending no credits boom
