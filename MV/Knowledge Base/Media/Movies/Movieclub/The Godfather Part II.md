## Notes
- DeNiro! So young
- Questions
	- Who called Fredo? Was it Johnny Ola?
	- Who is who? Who is Michael going against? 
	- Fredo with pneumonia, leeches? 
	- so wth happened at meeting with fanucci? Just guts? Threat? 
	- adt sign on the gate? 
	- was kay within her right to do that?
	- did he really forgive Fredo 
	- its not enough to win, others must lose
- dabbing his eyes with the water, from no sleep, nice touch I appreciated
- intermission! 
- is it the same senator as the beginning?
- asking for fruit scene 
- wiping eyes when back from Cuba 
- found it much more compelling 
- santino, Fredo, and then Michael 
- Tom: it was once (the roman emperor) 
- dang Fredo, Frankie five angels, and Roth all at once 
- significance of marines scene? Why at the end? His plans? 
- unfortunate that they didn't make a third 
- part 1 michael good guy, or at least righetous
- part 2 michael bad guy
