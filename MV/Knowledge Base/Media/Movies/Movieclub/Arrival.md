#### Notes
- Amy Adams character so detached
- I think I watched this once pre-kids, and once again after [[Bodin]] was born
- Hits different each time
- Very simple premise, figuring out a mystery/anthropological
- Watching this, you can tell Denis would have the best shot at making dune
- 'Abbott' is death process'. gives me chills
- future phone call with General Shang, chills again this time
- Would you have the kid? If you were jeremy renner would you leave? Horrible either way
- the picture of hannah as the canary, temporary, a price you pay for knowledge (she has to die for you get this power)
