#### Notes
- Covered the media part really well, peanut gallery comments
- It's twincest
- nancy grace and other people, media cycle
- the tyler perry superstar lawyer
- Fincher pace is legendary
- Book vs movie differences?
- Trent Reznor music
- Straight and to the point
- Nice house
- Rosamund not necessarily believable as her initial intro
- Good that a woman wrote this. She is like the redpill manosphere apex predator
- Gulf is bull sharks, nawlins'
- Was there ever a baby?
	- There can be
- Abuse inversion at the end, feminized man and dominant female
- Bookended beginning and ending
-
