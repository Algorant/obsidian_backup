Same strategy is the previous one except this time there will be 3 adds, which is fine because we’ll get healthback from Stun Grabs on them
Check video for full strategy
Combat tips:


Don’t attack The Hateful before the 3 adds spawn, if you hurt him he might buff up and gain a level


Deal with the adds one by one. Open up with Frozen Ascent. Follow up with Hyperion Grab + Sonic Arrows


Goal is to get 3 Stun Grabs to keep our HP high while dodging The Hateful


If you struggle, go top up your Rage Bar at the Mystic Gateway, this will make things a lot easier. Use Rage to kill the 3 Adds quickly.


This Hateful has a self-immolation buff which explodes on hit. When he does it, Axe Throw to detonate it from a distance or you’ll take a lot of damage if you’re close.

## EPISODE 25: COMPACT TEXT GUIDE FORMAT

Option: Upgrade Dauntless Shield to LVL 3 and start using it, see if you feel stronger with parrying. It builds Stun quicker than our Stone Wall Shield but you have to be good at parries or yellow attacks will hurt you. We can upgrade it to LEVEL 3 without sacrificing any materials we would need for the other shield. So you can swap between the 2 Shields and see what fits your playstyle more. On some bosses, one or the other shield will be better, so having options is nice.

Go for a Stun Grab but keep it above 60% HP, because at 50% there will be adds: 6 Legions

Back towards the objective, climb up and around the wall
Healthstone to the right
Open gate and follow Freya
Cut scene
Boss fight: Nidhogg
Check the video for full strategy
Combat tips:




Equip Stone Wall Shield. You can’t stun this guy so better blocking is preferable.


Use Blades of Chaos, Nidhogg is immune to frost


He can be immolated


Phase 1: get in his face and use Blades.


Block the yellow attacks.


Dodge the Red Circle attacks, it’s a Bifrost Claw Wave, dodge roll sideways.


He also does some normal attacks, be ready to block.


At 85% HP you’ll get a stun grab chance to drag Nidhogg out of the realm tear.




Phase 2:


New move: Tail Downward Thrust (simple Dodge once or just back off if you do it quickly enough, no dodging needed) then Birfrost Explosion (Double Tap L1 to interrupt)


If you Shield Break this move he’ll be open for a full R2 > R2 > R1 > R2 combo


You should never be too far away from Nidhogg so you can always Shield Break that move in time




The Bifrost Claw Wave now evolves into a Left-Right combo. Dodge roll sideways both waves.


Still does all the normal attacks and the yellow attacks which you can block.


At 60% HP Phase 3 will start.




Phase 3:


All the previous moves. Plus:


Yellow Attack: 3 or 4 Bifrost Lasers, you can block them (but bifrost will build up so dodging is preferable)


Red Attack: 2 or 3 Downward Tail Strikes through Realm Portals, single dodge is enough and once you get used to the visuals you’ll see it’s easy to time the dodges


NEW MOVE: Big Inhalation of Stones – Can be followed up by 2 different moves:


Stone Shower: Just keep shield up.


Red Circle: Large Bifrost Imbued Rock (Dodge Roll sideways. Can be multiple of those in a row)


Sometimes he’ll start with Stone Shower and follow up with a Big Rock


Extra tip: you can Axe Throw inside the belly while he’s inhaling. Only do this once you feel comfortable with this move.




When Nidhogg is perched up on one of the pillars, don’t try to attack. Switch to Axe, wait for Freya’s Sigils to detonate them and bring Nidhogg down. After falling down a pillar he’ll be staggered and you can unleash full blade combos.


When Nidhogg is on the ground, use Blades to do damage.


When Nidhogg is preched up on the other pillar, you’ll get an opportunity to light up Freya’s Sigils with the Blade this time. Hold L2 + R2 to light them on fire and bring Nidhogg down. Follow up with some heavy combos while he recovers.


At 10% HP he’ll fall down. Stun Grab to start Phase 4.




Phase 4:


Bifrost Claw Wave can now be done up to 4 times in a row.


Inhale Rock can now be interrupted by throwing Axe into Freya’s Sigil in the belly. She won’t always do this though.


If you succeed Nidhoog will fall down and be opened for a lot of damage.


Bring HP down to 0% for another Stun Grab.


GG!

Move up and turn left, loot pouch:

204 Hacksilver

Loot wooden chest:

540 Hacksilver

Move up to face boss: Frost Phantom
Check the video for strategy
Combat tips:


Keep shield up for most attacks


Use the Blades


There are two red circles attacks which look similar, the more dangerous one has a longer windup, you’ll see the Frost Phantom puff up


To dodge it you have to start walking backwards immediately as you see it, then double dodge as he dives for you




The other red circle dive attacks has a shorted windup but is stationary, you just have to double dodge backward immediately


Quickest way to build stun is to parry the yellow circle 1-2 combo. If you can, counter immediately after with Shield Strike (Dauntless Shield), or a regular R1 attack


Another easy way is when he summons the frost traps under your feet, sprint towards him after you dodge the first trap and hit the rune while it’s glowing


Note : right after the big wind up red circle attack it wilh resurface with the rune glowing. Try to hit it at that time as well.


Destroy pillar after first stun, Phase 2 starts


This phase is the same as Phase 1 but he’ll do more combos. He’ll use the short red circle attack twice in a row for example. He’ll also follow up the yellow 1-2 combo with a frost wave (just keep shield up for that one)


Don’t go aggressive, wait for the right time to strike the rune


There are 3 Healthstones scattered in each corner of this battlefield


Loots:

Jewel of Yggdrasil
3 Stonewood
25 Bonded Leather
25 Shattered Rune
1 Chaos Flame
3 Honed Metal
3 Dwarven Steel

Hard waves of many enemies coming up
Combat tips:


1st wave: Shadows


Blades – Une runics at the start


Then Scorched Sweeps is great to fend off multiple enemies infront of you


You can also use Furious Immolation to quickly maw through them




2nd wave: Wights and Nightmares


Hyperion Pull the Nightmares and throw them on other enemies.


You don’t have to kill the Revenants, just survive long enough.


It’s a tough wave, use Rage if overwhelmed




3rd wave:  Einherjars


Use Axe Runic Ability immediately to take some of them out


Try to get parries to stop them from attacking you


Use Relic to build rage back up and use Fury if you get overwhelmed


Our go-to combo of Frozen Ascent > Serpent’s Snare is quite effective here if you get enough space to use it


If that doesn’t work, switch back to Blades and use Scorched Sweeps

Climb up, just after Garm runs off is a new enemy type: Hel-Viken
Combat tips:


Very slow, hard hitting attacks. Prioritize dodging.


Use Blades. Use rage to take out the other Helwalker quickly first.


Use Scorched Sweep to burn from distance safely. Or Spear Throw.



Squeeze through walls, drop down

Move up to fight a Hel-Traveller
Combat tips:


This fight is all about learning how to dodge all the moves


Watch out for his sword combo with long lunge


Parrying is too high risk vs low reward


Nothing Staggers these, not even runic attacks. So always be ready to dodge and only use Runic Attacks right after dodging a combo.


Don’t use Cyclone of Chaos, the animation is too long and he’ll strike you before you finish it.


Throw Axe or Spear at the glowing orb that he will channel sometimes

Climb up, look up for hanging bucket:

1 Dwarven Steel


Open menu
Equip Stone Wall Shield + Rond of Purification – It’s a lot easier with it on this fight, a lot of yellow attacks with difficult parry timings, so blocking is safer

Move up, grapple over several times to reach boss fight: Garm
 
Check the video for full strategy
Combat tips:


Don’t Lock on – This boss is so big you’re better off with a free camera to see what’s going on


Remember you can use Wrath charges to get out of bad spots, like for example when your Stone Wall shield is fully charged and you don’t have time to release the charges before an incoming attack.


Phase 1 :


Block the 2 frost waves with shield, then dodge sideways for the red bite attack, immediately attack to Stagger Garm then do as much damage as possible


Repeat until his chain gets stuck in the ground, Axe Throw to freeze it then pull it.




Phase 2 :


Double dodge the red ice rocks he spits, he spits 2 in a row and sometimes he does 2 rounds of that


Sometimes the ice rocks become usable on the ground, make sure garm is close enough before you throw them


He does 4 Frost Waves now so you can’t block them all. I recommend running sideways and dodging the first two, then Block > Block


He’ll do a 4-Hit combo with his chain at the end, Double dodge one of the first 3, you can block the other 2. The final one is a red attack and must be dodged


Freeze the Chain and pull on it




Phase 3 :


From up a rock he’ll shoot ice shards at you, up to 8 in a row. Keep dodging and stay far away.


If you can grab a rock and throw it at Garm this will interrupt this move and he’ll fall back down. If not just wait until he jumps back down on his own.


When he jumps back down keep shield up to absorb the frost wave


When he gets close, dodge the last red attack and hit him immediately, just like in Phase 1 and 2


Note: don’t forget to use your Rage charges, they do a lot of damage but you can also use them to stun him in close range in case you miss your dodge on the red bite


When low on health he’ll do a final 4-combo chain attack, all red. Dodge them to survive and the chain will be stuck in the ice for the final freeze, pull and finishing moves (Hold X, then hold Square)

Get out of this area

Focus on the Wisps as soon as they pop up during the fight, retreat to the previous room to deal with them far away from the Traveller.


Throw Axe or Spear at the glowing orb quickly to interrupt the channeling or you’ll die to the big blast


Traveler carries a shield on its back, don’t bother hitting it. You have to hit this enemy from the front.

NorthEast check the plate and face Boss: Flame Phantom

Combat tips:


Use the Spear, it’s great against this enemy because it allows us to Stun it from long range


Flame Phantom has the same moveset as the Frost Phantom, but with a few extra moves


4-Hit downward strike: you can Dodge sideways the first hit and quickly Spear Throw at the core to Stun the Boss


Multiple flame eruption: you can also quickly Dodge sideways and Spear Throw at the core to get a Stun


You can also Stun by shooting at the core while he does the “Puff up and dive” move. Or you can wait for Flame Phantom to surface and quickly Spear Throw at the core. Either way you get a stun.


There are 5 Violet Springs to destroy. 4 Spear Throws + 1 Detonate is enough to destroy one Spring.


They are scattered across the central plains, drag the Boss close to the Springs before you Stun it.


The 5th Spring is way North on the other side of the ravine

Loot legendary chest:

250 Divine Ashes
1000 Hacksilver

 
 
Go back to the shop if you need a new Berserker’s Resurrection Stone
Go to the Left to the “F” Sword. Start trial: Weapon Mastery
Combat tips:


Run left and use both Blades Runics to quickly dispatch the first wave (Frost Layer)


Run opposite and use Breath of Thamur to kill 2nd wave (Fire Layer)


Use Spear Runics for the 3rd wave (Neutral layer)


This should be enough  of a headstart to comfortably finish the rest of the trial within the time limit


At some point there will be a Nokken, quickly take it out with Wrath.


Loot legendary chest:

250 Divine Ashes
1000 Hacksilver
Shoulder Guard of Undying Pyres

NEW FAVOUR: The Final Challenges
 
 
To activate the final challenges, we need to activate a rune combination on the main arena Sword
We’ll start with the “FN” rune combo, which will unlock final challenge #1.
 
Go to the left side trial, the sword with the “F” Rune engraved
Start the new trial [3]: Rampage
Combat tips:


Punt the Wisps on the Seidrs to kill them as fast as you can.


When the troll shows up, switch to Blades and use Cyclone of Chaos to quickly mount it and kill enemies with it.


After dismounting the troll, Stun it again with Meteoric Slam + Sonic Arrows. Ride it and kill more enemies, then finish the troll.


When the Bergsra comes, ignore it and kill 3 Wisps instead to get the last needed kills


Legendary chest:

4 Asgardian Ingot
1 Smouldering Embers
250 Divine Ashes
2500 Hacksilver



Go do the middle trial, the sword with the “N” Rune engrave
Start the new trial [3]: Health Steal
Combat tips:


Save your cooldowns for the Wight


When the Wight spawns, focus on killing the adds first, try to blow the Wisps onto the Wight


Then use Hilt of Hofud, follow up with Wrath of the Wolf and Spear Runic Attacks + Detonate


Save 2 Wrath Charges to deal with the 2 Nokkens on the last waves


Try to build Stun on most enemies to get health back from Stun Grabs. Hyperion Grapple is the best for this with our Hardened War Handles.


On the last wave, remember you can Stun Light Elves with Axe Throw to the face.


Loot legendary chest:

250 Divine Ashes
1 Blazing Embers
4 Luminous Alloy
2500 Hacksilver

EPISODE 86 END

## EPISODE 87: COMPACT TEXT GUIDE FORMAT

Go to the main arena, the “FN” Rune combination should be activated, which unlocks one of the 6 Final Trials.
Start trial: Endurance Challenge
Combat tips:


Things are pretty simple until you reach 45 enemies killed approximately, just sit at the back and use Spear mostly


At 45, a Frost Gradungr will come, use Blades cooldown to burn the frost layer off, use 1 Wrath Charge to quickly get rid of it.  Scorched Sweep / Meteroic Slam to finish the rest.


Switch back to Spear until wave 55.


Wave 55: troll comes, stun it quickly with Cyclone of Chaos / Hyperion Grab


Wave 75-85: Use Meteroic Slam and Breath of Thamur to kill the Wretches and Grims


Wave 85: Einherjars – Use Hilt of Hofud and Wrath Charges to thin up their numbers


Wave 99: Einherjar Warrior – Use Spear and Detonate to remove protective layer


Loot chest:

1 Blazing Embers
3 Smouldering Embers
2 Glowing Embers

5 Asgardian Ingots
1 Smouldering Embers
250 Divine Ashes
2500 Hacksilver


Go right to the “R” Sword.
Start the new trial [3]: Kill Fuse
Combat tips:


This one is pretty straight forward, you just have to be quick.


If you keep killing enemies regularly, you’ll get extra time.


Push enemies into the lava as much as possible for quick kills.


Save Breath of Thamur to deal with the wretches.


When the Wulver comes,  use the Wisps to damage it quickly.


Use cooldowns and wrath charges finish the job.


The only way to lose this challenge is when you take too long to kill a tanky enemy, and there are very few of those.


Loot the chest:

6 Petrified Bones
1 Glowing Embers
250 Divine Ashes
2500 Hacksilver


==

EPISODE 87 END

## EPISODE 88: COMPACT TEXT GUIDE FORMAT

Go to the main sword, the “FR” rune combination should be activated.
Start trial: Shield Breaker Challenge
Combat tips:


Open with Hilt of Hofud. Hyperion pull the 2 Nightmares and toss them on the grunts


Take your time to kill the grunts, unleash your cooldowns on the captain when the shield is down


Rinse and Repeat


When the Stalker comes, use Wrath Charges and any cooldown you have to finish off the Einherjar Captain


Then deal with the Stalker as usual, use spear, aim for the horns, create some distance and kill the adds while keeping an eye on the Stalker.


Loots:

2 Blazing Embers
3 Smouldering Embers
1 Glowing Embers
2500 Divine Ashes

Complete it and loot the chest:

1 Blazing Embers
2 Luminous Alloy
250 Divine Ashes
2500 Hacksilver

 
Go to the right trial again (R).
Start challenge: Kill Fuse
Loot legendary chest:

2500 Hacksilver

Go to the final trial sword, the “NR” Rune combination should appear on the sword

Go to the main sword, the “NR” rune combination should be activated.
Start trial: Onslaught Challenge
Combat tips:


Start with Axe and Spear Runics to clear the first waves


Save Blades Runic Attacks to quickly stun the Ogre  when it comes


Use Cyclone of Chaos to stun and mount the Ogre, kill as many enemies as you can with it


After dismounting the Ogre, keep it alive for when the Wyvern comes


Use Meteoric Slam to stun the Ogre a 2nd time and kill the Wyvern with it


It becomes messy as the timer goes down, you don’t have to kill everything but you must survive.


As usual use Wrath and Rez Stone to survive until the end.


We can buy a new Berserker Resurrection Stone for each trial. Hacksilver is no longer an issue, we can farm endless cash here.

Use the Spear to Stun the Phantom


During its weakened state, you can destroy all 3 pillars in a single phase if you throw 4 Spears at the 1st pillar, 4 Spears at the 2nd pillar and then detonate to take out both at once. Then you should have just enough time to do 3 Spears + Detonate + 4 Sonic Arrows


When the waves of enemies come, use Cyclone of Chaos, Meteoric Slam and Breath of Thamur while close to all enemies + Flame Phantom if possible


When the Frost Grandungr comes, use all Wrath Charges + Wrath of the Wolf to take it out as quickly as possible


Then back off and try to stun the Flame Phantom before dealing with the remaining enemies

## EPISODE 90: COMPACT TEXT GUIDE FORMAT

We got what we came here for: Surtr’s Wrist and Belt, one of the best 2-piece set bonus in the game, if not the best, especially in higher difficulties where enemies hit really hard, a 40% damage reduction is a huge deal.
And we’ll combine it with a new chest piece: Steinbjorn’s Armor, which will make us nearly unkillable.

Now we’ve got our final build which I call “The Vampire”. You’ll see how tanky we are now and how much health back we’ll get with this build. Now let’s put it to the test!

Combat tips:
1/ Traveller


Just take your time, don’t risk using big Runic attacks


2/ Stalker (Lancer type)


He’ll charge you right out of the gate, be ready to parry / dodge


Use spear from range for safety


3/ Dark Elf Lord


Spear Throw / Detonate from a safe distance


If he charged at you, you can catch him a well timed Hilt of Tyrfing. Or Valour if you’re too low on HP.


4/ Light Elf Slayer


Use Spear throw from a safe distance


Can also use other cooldowns to stagger and damage


Be ready to Double Tap L1 to interrupt Blue attack


5/ Einherjar Champion


Watch out for the hammer strike shockwave straight line – Dodge to the side


Scorched Sweep from mid range is great


All Runics stagger, use them


Last enemy, blow all Rage and cooldowns still available

3 Blazing Embers

Boss fight: Hrist & Mist
Check the video for detailed strategy
Combat tips:


Phase 1 should be easy, keep shield up, counter attack, Spear Throw


General Tip for this fight, always back away while shooting, create enough to distance so you can see both Valkyries at all times.




Phase 2 you’ll have to start dodging red attacks. Use the Spear


Keep your distances so you have both Valkyries in sight at all times, ready to dodge whatever comes your way.


Spear Throw and Detonate. Some of their attacks can be interrupted by Spear Throws or Detonate.


You can smash the rock they’re trying to throw at you with Spear Throws as well.


Only use other weapons to use runics when you get hit and need to Lifesteal health back.


Try to save all your Rage and Hilt of Hofud for Phase 3, which is where they really can kill you quickly, so the shorter the fight the better for us.




Phase 3 Start by throwing a lot of spears and detonating from long range. When they get close, focus on dodging the red attacks. They really hurt at this point, you can’t afford getting hit too much.


If Atreus gets grabbed, toss one spear at the valkyrie to free him. Or Detonate if you already had one spear embedded on her, which is why it’s a good idea to Spear Throw both Valkyries equally if possible.


If you need health back, use Fury.


Also use Hilt of Hofud during this fight to do as much damage as you can when they’re close.


Use Berserker’s Rez Stone if you die during this Phase, and immeditely use Fury after getting back up.




Phase 4 is simple, just press R1 or Square when prompted

Go to the sparring arena and fight boss: The Raven Keeper
Check the video for full strategy
Combat tips:


Use Sigil Arrows to stagger The Raven Keeper before any attacks (as usual with Revenants) and use Spear Throw from range to be safe


When Draugr adds spawn, switch to blades and go full stun mode (Sonic Arrows + Blades / Hyperion Grapple)


At low health, a dragon will attack you: The Pale One


Same strategy as usual with dragons: Spear throw when they’re swooping down on you. Switch to Sonic Arrows for the Dragon.


Use Runics to stagger them and do damage. Wrath of the Ancient Frost is great on this big target to gain a lot of health back, so make sure Bloodthirsty Retaliation is active before using this one.


Switch back to Sigil Arrows once the The Raven Keeper comes back.

Phase 1:


Keep the same gear as with the Thor fight


Focus on dodging Odin’s attacks and counter-attacking with short combos


Whenever you get hit, immediately use a Runic attack to Lifesteal some HP back


Spear is best in most situations since Odin moves around a lot and attacks from long range


At 70% HP he’ll do a big blast and Phase 2 will start



Phase 2:


He’ll start covering whole areas with Bifrost, move around the area to avoid them. As soon as you see him move to the center of the area, go near one of the ledges, ready to jump to the other side.


At 10% HP you’ll get a Stun Grab, Phase 3 will start


Cut scene involving Freya

Phase 3:


Use both Runic Summons from Freya and Atreus at the start to do a lot of damage.


Stay at long range, Spear Throw and Detonate


When Odin summons 5 Orbs who will come at you, use Spear Throw to quickly burst one of the Orbs, then Atreus and Freya will destroy the other orbs. Keep an eye on Odin who will still attack you while you deal with the Orb, you have to be quick.


At 50% you’ll get a Stun Grab and Phase 4 will start



Phase 4:


Destroy the Fire Layer with Leviathan’s Axe. Runic Attacks if available. Frozen Ascent otherwise.


He’ll use a Fire Breath attack you can simply Block.


Switch back to the Spear after that, do damage from range until he coats himself with a Frost Layer.




Destroy the Frost Layer with Blades Runic Attacks / Scorched Sweep


Switch back to the Spear after that, do damage from range until he coats himself with a Power Layer (he might not get to do that if you damage him too quickly)




Destroy Power layer with Spear Throw /  Draupnir’s Wail.


At low HP you’ll get another stun grab


Then a cinematic input chain, where you’ll have to press Square 3 times.

EQUIPMENT CHANGES

ENCHANTEMENT

Combat tips:


Use Blades at the start, hold R1 for Chaotic Rampa ge + Seidr Exhale + Sonic Arrows. Try to do as much damage as possible until he summons backup.


When he eventually succeeds, he’ll summon 2 Nightmares + 2 Draugrs


Go in the middle of the pack: Hilt of Tyrfing + Breath of Thamur or Meteoric Slam


Use Wrath to detonate a status effect for extra AoE damage as well


Clean up any remaining adds while keeping an eye on the Boss, ready to Dodge at all times




Then it’s a 1v1 fight vs Hvitserker The Bold until he summons another backup, try to interrupt him as much as possible.


He’s very elusive, so Spear Throw / Detonate is your best way to deal damage.


If he manages to summon backup again, do another Hilt of Tyrfing + Heavy Runic Attack


It’s a tough fight but we’re overgeared for it so it won’t be that bad.


You’ll probably need to use your Berserker Resurrection Stone

Then use Hilt of Tyrfing + Meteoric Slam on one of the sisters


Also use Spear Runics to refill HP if you get hit


Use all Wrath charges, Berserker’s Resurrection Stone and 4 more Wrath charges if needed to finish the Sisters


Then it’s a 1v1 against Svipdagar The Cold, just take your time and play it safe

## EPISODE 107: COMPACT TEXT GUIDE FORMAT

Back to the Mystic Gateway

Note: if you haven’t mastered Chaotic Rampage I, II and III yet, now would be a good time to do so before we face the last 2 Bosses in the game, which are also the hardest. Go to the training grounds to quickly do this before moving on to the next step.


Travel to Midgard > King’s Grave
South then East to the final Berserker Gravestone
Boss: King Hrolf Kraki
Check the video for full strategy
Keep Remedy of the Bifrost equipped for this fight.

Gear setup: Our usual Immortal Build with a few changes on Runic Attacks, using Breath of Thamur and Cyclone of Chaos is too risky because their animation is too long and can’t be cancelled. King Hrolf Kraki will gain the Armor Buff quite often and we don’t want to be stuck in an animation when he does, or we’ll get punished.

REPLACE Breath of Thamur with Leviathan’s Roar (UPGRADE to TIER III)
REPLACE Cyclone of Chaos with Rampage of the Furies (UPGRADE to TIER III)

Combat tips:


Sigil Arrows on Freya


Use Axe or Spear most of the time for quick throws to interrupt his big Bifrost blast when he levitates


Can use the Blades after he uses it as he always waits a while before using that particular move again


Use Wrath to get out of bad spots


You can also use Hilt of Tyrfing to interrupt an ability if you can’t make the dodge. Follow up with a Runic right after to Lifesteal HP back, as usual.


Then it’s all about learning how to Dodge and Block his moves, which should be manageable with Emblem of Elusion


King Hrolf Krati is extremely tanky, this will be a long battle, you have to be very patient. Deal damage only when it’s safe to do so.


Berserker’s Resurrection Stone might come in very handy for this fight



Achievement complete: Grave Mistake
Total Trophies Unlocked: 33/36

Check the video for the full strategy. This is the hardest Boss in God of War Ragnarök, expect a lot of deaths until you build the muscle memory to avoid most of her attacks. In GMGoW difficulty she still wrecks us even with our very tanky build. However, we can still take a few more hits and Lifesteal HP back so Setup 1 is better to learn how to fight Gna.

Setup 2 is more of a glass canon build, which shortens the fight by a lot but also makes us much more vulnerable, we’ll die in 1 or 2 hits with Setup #2, so you still need to learn how to avoid most her attacks, which is why I recommend starting with Setup #1 while learning Gna’s moves, then switch to Setup #2 if you struggle too much with Setup #1 (because it will be a very long fight with little room for mistakes).

In the next episode I’ll show you the other setup around the “Storm of Bifröst” and then we’ll wrap things up for good!

Check the video for the detailed strategy, this is a very specific build, Runic Attacks have to be done in quick succession and in the correct order to trigger Storm of Bifrost.

Then follow it up with Seidr Exchale + Hilt of Hofud to do massive damage during the Realm Shift, using Chaotic Rampage.

You’ll still have to dodge Gna’s attacks after that, but as soon as you get hit, use Fury immediately and pummel Gna to stall for time while youre Relic and Runic attacks refresh.
Relic will refresh very fast thanks to the Berserker’s Wrist and Girdle perks.
Then as soon as your 3 Runic Attacks are ready, wait for the right moment to redo the full combo again.
This fight will test your patience, especially if you’re on the higher difficulties. I’ve died many many times until I mastered this fight, and she still gets me sometimes!
