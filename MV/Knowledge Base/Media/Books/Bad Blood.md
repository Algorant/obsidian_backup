## Subtitle: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup

This book is crazy. I am writing this in 2023 and the villain of the book, [[Elizabeth Holmes]], just got sentenced to 11 years in prison. She is almost a different person now. With children. It feels wrong somehow.

That said, what she and the company did was pretty bananas. One is left thinking if they were an outlier, or more like a scapegoat for things that still happen to this day. Is this also what [[Amazon]], [[Uber]], etc are like before they reach escape velocity? I'm not sure.
