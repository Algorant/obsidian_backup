### What is this?

I sketched out some ideas on [[Prediction Markets]] with [[Roth]] on an #impromptuzoom call a couple days ago. (Today is 07-05-2023)

I kind of sketched out the basics of how I think one should work, how they are related to other ideas like #LVT Land Value Tax and other #georgist ideas.
