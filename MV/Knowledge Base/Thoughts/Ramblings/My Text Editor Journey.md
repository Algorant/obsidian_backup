I began my text editor journey on one called #sublime, which has now been deprecated. It was originally created by [[Github]] people, but when [[Microsoft]] bought them, it then made no sense to continue development (because [[Microsoft]] already had #vs-code).

I think from there I also tried #atom which is still around. I was learning [[Python]] at the same time and I think I saw [[Cory Schafer]] use it. It had a really nice functionality that was #repl like in function. He could write code and then execute it in a window near the bottom of his screen, and I thought that was so cool.  This was kind of concurrent or maybe even before I learned about [[Jupyter]] notebooks and etc.

Anyway from #atom I think is when I made the jump to [[VS Code]] and used that for a while, but as I learned more about #computers and #programming in general, I became aware of the holy grail greybeard software known as #vim.  

It was definitely intimidating at first.  But eventually I bit the bullet when bored one day and just dove in. And I am so glad I did. Its very rewarding to create something that feels like a well-sharpened tool, customized solely to you in a way that other text editors just won't be able to compete with.

I definitely have an addiction to trying out new tools and frameworks, and having that #greenfield, there is no limit to what I can accomplish, the sky's the limit feeling. I have to be careful otherwise I get caught in loops of doing it over and over whether that's in #games or #life or #knowledge-management tools like #Obsidian . I'll be careful.

[[VS Code]] is fantastic and I might dabble and go back to it one day, and it's definitely useful in a pinch, but as far as my preferences go, I love my [[neovim]] config and I'm never going back.
