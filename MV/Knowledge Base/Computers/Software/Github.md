[[Github]] is a site where people interact and store things related to #git.  I have many of my repos there, including where I house copies or versions of all my software projects.


### Here are some examples as a [[Dataview]] from my #tech-projects folder:

#### Dataview:

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
file.link as "Name", description, links, repo, todo, tags
FROM "Projects/Tech"
```

### And here are some other useful #repos that I have:

- My [Dotfiles](link to dotfiles) for various systems (separate between [[Arch]] or something like [[WSL]])
	- This will include settings for programs like my current favorite:
		-  #terminal emulator of choice: [[kitty]]
		-  shell: [[zsh]]
		- #tiling-window-manager: [[qtile]]
		- theme: a custom version of [[gruvbox]], but I also like [[dracula]]
		- Various smaller settings for things like other #command-line tools such as:
			- [[duf]], [[bat]], [[lsd]], [[Starship]], [[ripgrep]], [[pass]], [[gnu stow]], etc.
