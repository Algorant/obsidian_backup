#### Installing on Arch
- Get the full thing from the [[AUR]] with extras. For me it was called `spotify-player-full-pipe`.
- Get `libsixel` and `libspotify` as dependencies
- Config is in .config/spotify-player
- Look into making your own client using their api which will give you a client-id to use.
- will save in [[gnu stow]] [[dotfiles]]
