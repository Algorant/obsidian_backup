A fork of the popular text editor known as #vim.  There is a long and storied history there, but the gist is that #neovim is now where its at and likely will remain so.

I have my own #config for it that I call [[Algovim]]. It's got a lot of features, and shortcuts that feel comfy to me. I definitely neither am using it to my standard, nor anywhere near the potential of what it could have.

But baby steps and I will get there.
