An addon or companion for 

Short for #terminal-multiplexer but who has time for that #gobbledygook?  

It's a command line program for people who like recursion and working with multiple things at once. It can also maintain an entire "sessions" which is like a working window with all your stuff, which you can export to other computers or suspend and resume on the fly.

I am still very inexperienced with it, but hope to unlock its powers as I spend more time in #linux.
