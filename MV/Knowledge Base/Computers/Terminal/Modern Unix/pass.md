alias: Password Store, password-store

[[pass]] aka [[pass|password-store]] is a #command-line utility that can store passwords for you. It is:
- easy to use
- has #git functionality built in
- uses #gpg under the hood

I can definitely see myself using this for secrets that I tend to use only on command line, or for saving things like #api-keys or other secrets, either for personal projects or for any work I do in the future.

I will stick with my [[Bitwarden]] vault for most things outside of that, though. This is just a nice backup to have that you can move across computers easily as well.
