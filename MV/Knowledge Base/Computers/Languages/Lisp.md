A family of programming languages created by [[John McCarthy]].  There is a lot of mythos around #lisp.

My exposure to it mostly comes from [[Paul Graham]].  He has some useful links such as:
- [Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html)
- [Lisp FAQ](http://www.paulgraham.com/lispfaq1.html)

I plan to write my own #lisp , first in [[Python]] and then in [[Rust]].  There is plenty of scaffolding to learn how to online, most notably [this](https://norvig.com/lispy.html) one by [[Peter Norvig]].

He also has a followup [here](https://norvig.com/lispy2.html).


These exercises would be more as a meta-exercise to get better at #computer-science and #programming in general. People who learn this language or framework do tend to love it, and have a hard time programming in anything else without getting frustrated thereafter. 

In a way, this makes it like the #dark-souls or #soulsborne of #programming-langauges. Haha
